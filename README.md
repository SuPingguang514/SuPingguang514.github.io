#  1 Scope

The present document defines the Stage 2 system architecture for the 5G
System. The 5G System provides data connectivity and services.

This specification covers both roaming and non-roaming scenarios in all
aspects, including interworking between 5GS and EPS, mobility within
5GS, QoS, policy control and charging, authentication and in general 5G
System wide features e.g. SMS, Location Services, Emergency Services.

ITU‑T Recommendation I.130 \[11\] describes a three-stage method for
characterisation of telecommunication services, and
ITU‑T Recommendation Q.65 \[12\] defines Stage 2 of the method.

TS 23.502 \[3\] contains the stage 2 procedures and flows for 5G System
and it is a companion specification to this specification.

TS 23.503 \[45\] contains the stage 2 Policy Control and Charging
architecture for 5G System and it is a companion specification to this
specification.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations

## 3.1 Definitions

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**5G VN Group:** A set of UEs using private communication for 5G
LAN-type service.

**5G Access Network:** An access network comprising a NG-RAN and/or
non-3GPP AN connecting to a 5G Core Network.

**5G Access Stratum-based Time Distribution:** A time synchronization
distribution method that is used by an NG-RAN to provide the 5GS time to
the UE(s) over the radio interface using procedures specified in
TS 38.331 \[28\].

**5G Core Network:** The core network specified in the present document.
It connects to a 5G Access Network.

**5G LAN-Type Service:** A service over the 5G system offering private
communication using IP and/or non-IP type communications.

**5G LAN-Virtual Network:** A virtual network over the 5G system capable
of supporting 5G LAN-type service.

**5G NSWO:** The 5G NSWO is the capability provided by 5G system and by
UE to enable the connection to a WLAN access network using 5GS
credentials without registration to 5GS.

**5G QoS Flow or QoS Flow:** The finest granularity for QoS forwarding
treatment in the 5G System. All traffic mapped to the same 5G QoS Flow
receive the same forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling policy, queue
management policy, rate shaping policy, RLC configuration, etc.).
Providing different QoS forwarding treatment requires separate 5G QoS
Flow.

**5G QoS Identifier:** A scalar that is used as a reference to a
specific QoS forwarding behaviour (e.g. packet loss rate, packet delay
budget) to be provided to a 5G QoS Flow. This may be implemented in the
access network by the 5QI referencing node specific parameters that
control the QoS forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling weights, admission
thresholds, queue management thresholds, link layer protocol
configuration, etc.).

**5G System:** 3GPP system consisting of 5G Access Network (AN), 5G Core
Network and UE.

**5G-BRG:** The 5G-BRG is a 5G-RG defined in BBF.

**5G-CRG:** The 5G-CRG is a 5G-RG specified in DOCSIS MULPI \[89\].

**5G-RG:** A 5G-RG is a RG capable of connecting to 5GC playing the role
of a UE with regard to the 5G core. It supports secure element and
exchanges N1 signalling with 5GC. The 5G-RG can be either a 5G-BRG or
5G-CRG.

**Access Traffic Steering:** The procedure that selects an access
network for a new data flow and transfers the traffic of this data flow
over the selected access network. Access traffic steering is applicable
between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.

**Access Traffic Switching:** The procedure that moves all traffic of an
ongoing data flow from one access network to another access network in a
way that maintains the continuity of the data flow. Access traffic
switching is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.

**Access Traffic Splitting:** The procedure that splits the traffic of a
data flow across multiple access networks. When traffic splitting is
applied to a data flow, some traffic of the data flow is transferred via
one access and some other traffic of the same data flow is transferred
via another access. Access traffic splitting is applicable between one
3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.

**Allowed NSSAI**: Indicating the S-NSSAIs values the UE could use in
the Serving PLMN in the current Registration Area.

**Allowed Area:** Area where the UE is allowed to initiate communication
as specified in clause 5.3.2.3.

**AMF Region:** An AMF Region consists of one or multiple AMF Sets.

**AMF Set:** An AMF Set consists of some AMFs that serve a given area
and Network Slice(s). AMF Set is unique within an AMF Region and it
comprises of AMFs that support the same Network Slice(s). Multiple AMF
Sets may be defined per AMF Region. The AMF instances in the same AMF
Set may be geographically distributed but have access to the same
context data.

**Application Identifier:** An identifier that can be mapped to a
specific application traffic detection rule.

**AUSF Group ID:** This refers to one or more AUSF instances managing a
specific set of SUPIs. An AUSF Group consists of one or multiple AUSF
Sets.

**Binding Indication:** Information included by a NF service producer to
a NF service consumer in request responses or notifications to convey
the scope within which selection/reselection of target NF/NF Services
may be performed, or information included by the NF service consumer in
requests or subscriptions to convey the scope within which
selection/reselection of notification targets or the selection of other
service(s) that the NF consumer produces for the same data context may
be performed. See clause 6.3.1.0.

**BSF Group ID:** This refers to one or more BSF instances managing a
specific set of SUPIs or GPSIs. A BSF Group consists of one or multiple
BSF Sets.

**Configured NSSAI:** NSSAI provisioned in the UE applicable to one or
more PLMNs.

**CHF Group ID:** This refers to one or more CHF instances managing a
specific set of SUPIs.

**Credentials Holder:** Entity which authenticates and authorizes access
to an SNPN separate from the Credentials Holder.

**Default UE credentials:** Information configured in the UE to make the
UE uniquely identifiable and verifiably secure to perform UE onboarding.

**Default Credentials Server (DCS):** An entity that can perform
authentication based on the Default UE credentials or provide means for
another entity to perform authentication based on the Default UE
credentials.

**Disaster Roaming:** See definition in TS 22.261 \[2\].

**DN Access Identifier (DNAI):** Identifier of a user plane access to
one or more DN(s) where applications are deployed.

**Emergency Registered:** A UE is considered Emergency Registered over
an Access Type in a PLMN when registered for emergency services only
over this Access Type in this PLMN.

**Endpoint Address:** An address in the format of an IP address or FQDN,
which is used to determine the host/authority part of the target URI.
This Target URI is used to access an NF service (i.e. to invoke service
operations) of an NF service producer or for notifications to an NF
service consumer.

**En-gNB:** as defined in TS 37.340 \[31\].

**Expected UE Behaviour:** Set of parameters provisioned by an external
party to 5G network functions on the foreseen or expected UE behaviour,
see clause 5.20.

**Fixed Network Residential Gateway:** A Fixed Network RG (FN-RG) is a
RG that it does not support N1 signalling and it is not 5GC capable.

**Fixed Network Broadband Residential Gateway:** A Fixed Network RG

# 4 Architecture model and concepts

## 4.1 General concepts

The 5G System architecture is defined to support data connectivity and
services enabling deployments to use techniques such as e.g. Network
Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networking. The 5G System
architecture shall leverage service-based interactions between Control
Plane (CP) Network Functions where identified. Some key principles and
concept are to:

\- Separate the User Plane (UP) functions from the Control Plane (CP)
functions, allowing independent scalability, evolution and flexible
deployments e.g. centralized location or distributed (remote) location.

\- Modularize the function design, e.g. to enable flexible and efficient
network slicing.

\- Wherever applicable, define procedures (i.e. the set of interactions
between network functions) as services, so that their re-use is
possible.

\- Enable each Network Function and its Network Function Services to
interact with other NF and its Network Function Services directly or
indirectly via a Service Communication Proxy if required. The
architecture does not preclude the use of another intermediate function
to help route Control Plane messages (e.g. like a DRA).

\- Minimize dependencies between the Access Network (AN) and the Core
Network (CN). The architecture is defined with a converged core network
with a common AN - CN interface which integrates different Access Types
e.g. 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

\- Support a unified authentication framework.

\- Support \"stateless\" NFs, where the \"compute\" resource is
decoupled from the \"storage\" resource.

\- Support capability exposure.

\- Support concurrent access to local and centralized services. To
support low latency services and local access to data networks, UP
functions can be deployed close to the Access Network.

\- Support roaming with both Home routed traffic as well as Local
breakout traffic in the visited PLMN.

## 4.2 Architecture reference model

### 4.2.1 General

This specification describes the architecture for the 5G System. The 5G
architecture is defined as service-based and the interaction between
network functions is represented in two ways.

\- A service-based representation, where network functions (e.g. AMF)
within the Control Plane enables other authorized network functions to
access their services. This representation also includes point-to-point
reference points where necessary.

\- A reference point representation, shows the interaction exist between
the NF services in the network functions described by point-to-point
reference point (e.g. N11) between any two network functions (e.g. AMF
and SMF).

Service-based interfaces are listed in clause 4.2.6. Reference points
are listed in clause 4.2.7.

Network functions within the 5GC Control Plane shall only use
service-based interfaces for their interactions.

NOTE 1: The interactions between NF services within one NF are not
specified in this Release of the specification.

NOTE 2: UPF does not provide any services in this Release of the
specification, but can consume services provided by 5GC Control Plane
NFs.

NFs and NF services can communicate directly, referred to as Direct

Figure 4.2.4-1: Roaming 5G System architecture- local breakout scenario
in service-based interface representation

NOTE 1: In the LBO architecture. the PCF in the VPLMN may interact with
the AF in order to generate PCC Rules for services delivered via the
VPLMN, the PCF in the VPLMN uses locally configured policies according
to the roaming agreement with the HPLMN operator as input for PCC Rule
generation, the PCF in VPLMN has no access to subscriber policy
information from the HPLMN, the NSACF in the HPLMN is not used in this
Release of the specification.

NOTE 2: An SCP can be used for indirect communication between NFs and NF
services within the VPLMN, within the HPLMN, or in within both VPLMN and
HPLMN. For simplicity, the SCP is not shown in the roaming architecture.

NOTE 5: The NRF is not depicted in reference point architecture figures.
Refer to Figure 4.2.4-7 for details on NRF and NF interfaces.

NOTE 6: For the sake of clarity, SEPPs are not depicted in the roaming
reference point architecture figures.

reference point representation

The N38 references point can be between V-SMFs in the same VPLMN, or
between V-SMFs in different VPLMNs (to enable inter-PLMN mobility).

For the roaming scenarios described above each PLMN implements proxy
functionality to secure interconnection and hide topology on the
inter-PLMN interfaces.

![](media/image12.emf)

representation

NOTE 7: For the sake of clarity, SEPPs on both sides of PLMN borders are
not depicted in figure 4.2.4-7.

Figure 4.2.4-8: Void

Operators can deploy UPFs supporting the Inter PLMN UP Security (IPUPS)
functionality at the border of their network to protect their network
from invalid inter PLMN N9 traffic in home routed roaming scenarios. The
UPFs supporting the IPUPS functionality in VPLMN and HPLMN are
controlled by the V-SMF and the H-SMF of that PDU Session respectively.
A UPF supporting the IPUPS functionality terminates GTP-U N9 tunnels.
The SMF can activate the IPUPS functionality together with other UP
functionality in the same UPF, or insert a separate UPF for the IPUPS
functionality in the UP path (which e.g. may be dedicated to be used for
IPUPS functionality). Figure 4.2.4-9 depicts the home routed roaming
architecture where a UPF is inserted in the UP path for the IPUPS
functionality. Figure 4.2.4-3 depicts the home routed roaming
architecture where the two UPFs perform the IPUPS functionality and
other UP functionality for the PDU Session.

NOTE 8: Operators are not prohibited from deploying the IPUPS
functionality as a separate Network Function from the UPF, acting as a
transparent proxy which can transparently read N4 and N9 interfaces.
However, such deployment option is not specified and needs to take at
least into account very long lasting PDU Sessions with infrequent
traffic and Inter-PLMN handover.

The IPUPS functionality is specified in clause 5.8.2.14 and
TS 33.501 \[29\].

### 4.2.5 Data Storage architectures

As depicted in Figure 4.2.5-1, the 5G System architecture allows any NF
to store and retrieve its unstructured data into/from a UDSF (e.g. UE
contexts). The UDSF belongs to the same PLMN where the network function
is located. CP NFs may share a UDSF for storing their respective
unstructured data or may each have their own UDSF (e.g. a UDSF may be
located close to the respective NF).

NOTE 1: Structured data in this specification refers to data for which
the structure is defined in 3GPP specifications. Unstructured data
refers to data for which the structure is not defined in 3GPP
specifications.

![](media/image14.emf)

Figure 4.2.5-1: Data Storage Architecture for unstructured data from any
NF

NOTE 2: 3GPP will specify (possibly by referencing) the N18/Nudsf
interface.

As depicted in Figure 4.2.5-2, the 5G System architecture allows the
UDM, PCF and NEF to store data in the UDR, including subscription data
and policy data by UDM and PCF, structured data for exposure and
application data (including Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) for
application detection, AF request information for multiple UEs) by the
NEF. UDR can be deployed in each PLMN and it can serve different
functions as follows:

\- UDR accessed by the NEF belongs to the same PLMN where the NEF is
located.

\- UDR accessed by the UDM belongs to the same PLMN where the UDM is
located if UDM supports a split architecture.

\- UDR accessed by the PCF belongs to the same PLMN where the PCF is
located.

NOTE 3: The UDR deployed in each PLMN can store application data for
roaming subscribers.

![](media/image15.emf)

Figure 4.2.5-2: Data Storage Architecture

NOTE 4: There can be multiple UDRs deployed in the network, each of
which can accommodate different data sets or subsets, (e.g. subscription
data, subscription policy data, data for exposure, application data)
and/or serve different sets of NFs. Deployments where a UDR serves a
single NF and stores its data, and, thus, can be integrated with this
NF, can be possible.

NOTE 5: The internal structure of the UDR in figure 4.2.5-2 is shown for
information only.

The Nudr interface is defined for the network functions (i.e. NF Service
Consumers), such as UDM, PCF and NEF, to access a particular set of the
data stored and to read, update (including add, modify), delete, and
subscribe to notification of relevant data changes in the UDR.

Each NF Service Consumer accessing the UDR, via Nudr, shall be able to
add, modify, update or delete only the data it is authorised to change.
This authorisation shall be performed by the UDR on a per data set and
NF service consumer basis and potentially on a per UE, subscription
granularity.

The following data in the UDR sets exposed via Nudr to the respective NF
service consumer and stored shall be standardized:

\- Subscription Data,

\- Policy Data,

\- Structured Data for exposure,

\- Application data: Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) for application
detection and AF request information for multiple UEs, as defined in
clause 5.6.7.

The service based Nudr interface defines the content and format/encoding
of the 3GPP defined information elements exposed by the data sets.

In addition, it shall be possible to access operator specific data sets
by the NF Service Consumers from the UDR as well as operator specific
data for each data set.

NOTE 6: The content and format/encoding of operator specific data and
operator specific data sets are not subject to standardization.

NOTE 7: The organization of the different data stored in the UDR is not
to be standardized.

### 4.2.8 Support of non-3GPP access

#### 4.2.8.0 General

In this Release of the specification, the following types of non-3GPP
access networks are defined:

\- Untrusted non-3GPP access networks;

\- Trusted non-3GPP access networks; and

\- Wireline access networks.

The architecture to support Untrusted and Trusted non-3GPP access
networks is defined in clause 4.2.8.2. The architecture to support
Wireline access networks is defined in clause 4.2.8.2.4 and in
TS 23.316 \[84\].

#### 4.2.8.1 General Concepts to Support Trusted and Untrusted Non-3GPP Access

The 5G Core Network supports connectivity of UEs via non-3GPP access
networks, e.g. WLAN access networks.

Only the support of non-3GPP access networks deployed outside the NG-RAN
is described in this clause.

The 5G Core Network supports both untrusted non-3GPP access networks and
trusted non-3GPP access networks (TNANs).

An untrusted non-3GPP access network shall be connected to the 5G Core
Network via a Non-3GPP InterWorking Function (N3IWF), whereas a trusted
non-3GPP access network shall be connected to the 5G Core Network via a
Trusted Non-3GPP Gateway Function (TNGF). Both the N3IWF and the TNGF
interface with the 5G Core Network CP and UP functions via the N2 and N3
interfaces, respectively.

A non-3GPP access network may advertise the PLMNs for which it supports
trusted connectivity and the type of supported trusted connectivity
(e.g. \"5G connectivity\"). Therefore, the UEs can discover the non-3GPP
access networks that can provide trusted connectivity to one or more
PLMNs. This is further specified in clause 6.3.12 (Trusted Non-3GPP
Access Network selection).

The UE decides to use trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access for
connecting to a 5G PLMN by using procedures not specified in this
document. Examples of such procedures are defined in clause 6.3.12.1.

When the UE decides to use untrusted non-3GPP access to connect to a 5G
Core Network in a PLMN:

\- the UE first selects and connects with a non-3GPP access network; and
then

\- the UE selects a PLMN and an N3IWF in this PLMN. The PLMN/N3IWF
selection and the non-3GPP access network selection are independent. The
N3IWF selection is defined in clause 6.3.6.

When the UE decides to use trusted non-3GPP access to connect to a 5G
Core Network in a PLMN:

\- the UE first selects a PLMN; and then

\- the UE selects a non-3GPP access network (a TNAN) that supports
trusted connectivity to the selected PLMN. In this case, the non-3GPP
access network selection is affected by the PLMN selection.

A UE that accesses the 5G Core Network over a non-3GPP access shall,
after UE registration, support NAS signalling with 5G Core Network
control-plane functions using the N1 reference point.

When a UE is connected via a NG-RAN and via a non-3GPP access, multiple
N1 instances shall exist for the UE i.e. there shall be one N1 instance
over NG-RAN and one N1 instance over non-3GPP access.

A UE simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network of a PLMN over
a 3GPP access and a non-3GPP access shall be served by a single AMF in
this 5G Core Network.

When a UE is connected to a 3GPP access of a PLMN, if the UE selects a
N3IWF and the N3IWF is located in a PLMN different from the PLMN of the
3GPP access, e.g. in a different VPLMN or in the HPLMN, the UE is served
separately by the two PLMNs. The UE is registered with two separate
AMFs. PDU Sessions over the 3GPP access are served by V-SMFs different
from the V-SMF serving the PDU Sessions over the non-3GPP access. The
same can be true when the UE uses trusted non-3GPP access, i.e. the UE
may select one PLMN for 3GPP access and a different PLMN for trusted
non-3GPP access.

NOTE: The registrations with different PLMNs over different Access Types
doesn\'t apply to UE registered for Disaster Roaming service as
described in the clause 5.40.

The PLMN selection for the 3GPP access does not depend on the PLMN that
is used for non-3GPP access. In other words, if a UE is registered with
a PLMN over a non-3GPP access, the UE performs PLMN selection for the
3GPP access independently of this PLMN.

A UE shall establish an IPsec tunnel with the N3IWF or with the TNGF in
order to register with the 5G Core Network over non-3GPP access. Further
details about the UE registration to 5G Core Network over untrusted
non-3GPP access and over trusted non-3GPP access are described in
clause 4.12.2 and in clause 4.12.2a of TS 23.502 \[3\], respectively.

It shall be possible to maintain the UE NAS signalling connection with
the AMF over the non-3GPP access after all the PDU Sessions for the UE
over that access have been released or handed over to 3GPP access.

N1 NAS signalling over non-3GPP accesses shall be protected with the
same security mechanism applied for N1 over a 3GPP access.

User plane QoS differentiation between UE and N3IWF is supported as
described in clause 5.7 and clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. QoS
differentiation between UE and TNGF is supported as described in
clause 5.7 and clause 4.12a.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 4.2.8.1A General Concepts to support Wireline Access

Wireline 5G Access Network (W-5GAN) shall be connected to the 5G Core
Network via a Wireline Access Gateway Function (W-AGF). The W-AGF
interfaces the 5G Core Network CP and UP functions via N2 and N3
interfaces, respectively.

For the scenario of 5G-RG connected via NG RAN the specification for UE
defined in this TS, TS 23.502 \[3\] and TS 23.503 \[45\] are applicable
as defined for UE connected to 5GC via NG RAN unless differently
specified in this TS and in TS 23.316 \[84\].

When a 5G-RG is connected via a NG-RAN and via a W-5GAN, multiple N1
instances shall exist for the 5G-RG i.e. there shall be one N1 instance
over NG-RAN and one N1 instance over W-5GAN.

A 5G-RG simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network of a PLMN
over a 3GPP access and a W-5GAN access shall be served by a single AMF
in this 5G Core Network.

5G-RG shall maintain the NAS signalling connection with the AMF over the
W-5GAN after all the PDU Sessions for the 5G-RG over that access have
been released or handed over to 3GPP access.

The 5G-RG connected to 5GC via NG-RAN is specified in TS 23.316 \[84\].

For the scenario of FN-RG, which is not 5G capable, connected via W-5GAN
to 5GC, the W-AGF provides the N1 interface to AMF on behalf of the
FN-RG.

An UE connected to a 5G-RG or FN-RG can access to the 5GC via the N3IWF
or via the TNGF where the combination of 5G-RG/FN-RG, W-AGF and UPF
serving the 5G-RG or FN-RG is acting respectively as Untrusted Non-3GPP
access network or as a Trusted Non-3GPP access network defined in
clause 4.2.8.2; for example a UE is connecting to 5G-RG by means of WLAN
radio access and connected to 5GC via N3IWF. The detailed description is
specified in TS 23.316 \[84\].

The roaming architecture for 5G-BRG, FN-BRG, 5G-CRG and FN-CRG with the
W-5GAN is not specified in this Release. The Home Routed roaming
scenario is supported for 5G-RG connected via NG RAN, while Local
Breakout scenario is not supported.

5G Multi-Operator Core Network (5G MOCN) is supported for 5G-RG
connected via NG RAN as defined in clause 5.18

#### 4.2.8.3 Reference Points for Non-3GPP Access

##### 4.2.8.3.1 Overview

The description of the reference points specific for the non-3GPP
access:

N2, N3, N4, N6: these are defined in clause 4.2.

**Y1** Reference point between the UE and the untrusted non-3GPP access
(e.g. WLAN). This depends on the non-3GPP access technology and is
outside the scope of 3GPP.

**Y2** Reference point between the untrusted non-3GPP access and the
N3IWF for the transport of NWu traffic.

**Y4** Reference point between the 5G-RG and the W-AGF which transports
the user plane traffic and the N1 NAS protocol. The definition of this
interface is outside the scope of 3GPP.

**Y5** Reference point between the FN-RG and the W-AGF. The definition
of this interface is outside the scope of 3GPP.

**Yt** Reference point between the UE and the TNAP. See e.g. Figure
4.2.8.2.1-2.

**Yt\'** Reference point between the N5CW devices and the TWAP. It is
defined in clause 4.2.8.5.

**NWu** Reference point between the UE and N3IWF for establishing secure
tunnel(s) between the UE and N3IWF so that control-plane and user-plane
exchanged between the UE and the 5G Core Network is transferred securely
over untrusted non-3GPP access.

**NWt** Reference point between the UE and the TNGF. A secure NWt
connection is established over this reference point, as specified in
clause 4.12a.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. NAS messages between the UE and the
AMF are transferred via this NWt connection.

**Ta** A reference point between the TNAP and the TNGF, which is used to
support an AAA interface. Ta requirements are documented in
clause 4.2.8.3.2.

**Tn** A reference point between two TNGFs, which is used to facilitate
UE mobility between different TNGFs (inter-TNGF mobility).

Tn and inter-TNGF mobility are not specified in this Release of the
specification.

##### 4.2.8.3.2 Requirements on Ta

Ta shall be able to

\- Carry EAP-5G traffic and user location information before the NWt
connection is established between the UE and the TNGF.

\- Allow the UE and the TNGF to exchange IP traffic.

In deployments where the TNAP does not allocate the local IP addresses
to UE(s), Ta shall be able to:

\- Allow the UE to request and receive IP configuration from the TNAN
(including a local IP address), e.g. with DHCP. This is to allow the UE
to use an IP stack to establish a NWt connection between the UE and the
TNGF.

NOTE: The \"local IP address\" is the IP address that allows the UE to
contact the TNGF; the entity providing this local IP address is part of
TNAN and out of 3GPP scope

In this Release of the specification, Ta is not specified.

#### 4.2.8.4 Architecture Reference Model for Wireline Access network

#### 4.2.8.5 Access to 5GC from devices that do not support 5GC NAS over WLAN access

##### 4.2.8.5.1 General

The devices that do not support 5GC NAS signalling over WLAN access are
referred to as \"Non-5G-Capable over WLAN\" devices, or N5CW devices for
short. A N5CW device is not capable to operate as a 5G UE that supports
5GC NAS signalling over a WLAN access network, however, it may be
capable to operate as a 5G UE over NG-RAN.

Clause 4.2.8.5 specifies the 5GC architectural enhancements that enable
N5CW devices to access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks. A trusted
WLAN access network is a particular type of a Trusted Non-3GPP Access
Network (TNAN) that supports a WLAN access technology, e.g. IEEE 802.11.
Not all trusted WLAN access networks support 5GC access from N5CW
devices. To support 5GC access from N5CW devices, a trusted WLAN access
network must support the special functionality specified below (e.g. it
must support a TWIF function).

When a N5CW device performs an EAP-based access authentication procedure
to connect to a trusted WLAN access network, the N5CW device may
simultaneously be registered to a 5GC of a PLMN. The 5GC registration is
performed by the TWIF function (see next clause) in the trusted WLAN
access network, on behalf of the N5CW device. The type of EAP
authentication procedure, which is used during the 5GC registration to
authenticate the N5CW device, is specified in TS 33.501 \[29\]. In this
Release of the specification, Trusted WLAN Access for N5CW Device only
supports IP PDU Session type.

##### 4.2.8.5.2 Reference Architecture

The architecture diagram below is based on the general 5GS architecture
diagrams in clause 4.2 and shows the main network functions required to
support 5GC access from N5CW devices. Other network functions are not
shown for simplicity.

![](media/image30.emf)

Figure 4.2.8.5.2-1: Non-roaming and LBO Roaming Architecture for
supporting 5GC access from N5CW devices

##### 4.2.8.5.3 Network Functions

Trusted WLAN Access Point (TWAP): It is a particular type of a Trusted
Non-3GPP Access Point (TNAP) specified in clause 4.2.8.2, that supports
a WLAN access technology, e.g. IEEE 802.11. This function is outside the
scope of the 3GPP specifications.

Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF): It provides interworking
functionality that enables N5CW devices to access 5GC. The TWIF supports
the following functions:

\- Terminates the N1, N2 and N3 interfaces.

\- Implements the AMF selection procedure.

\- Implements the NAS protocol stack and exchanges NAS messages with the
AMF on behalf of the N5CW device.

\- On the user plane, it relays protocol data units (PDUs) between the
Yw interface and the N3 interface.

\- May implement a local mobility anchor within the trusted WLAN access
network.

##### 4.2.8.5.4 Reference Points

The Yt\' and Yw reference points are both outside the scope of the 3GPP
specifications. The Yt\' reference point transports WLAN messages (e.g.
IEEE 802.11 messages), while the Yw reference point:

\- Shall be able to transport authentication messages between the TNAP
and the TWIF for enabling authentication of a N5CW device;

\- Shall allow the N5CW device to request and receive IP configuration
from the TWIF, including an IP address, e.g. with DHCP.

\- Shall support the transport of user-plane traffic for the N5CW
device.

The N1, N2 and N3 reference points are the same reference points defined
in clause 4.2.7.

### 4.2.9 Network Analytics architecture

The Network Analytics architecture is defined in TS 23.288 \[86\].

### 4.2.10 Architecture Reference Model for ATSSS Support

In order to support the ATSSS feature, the 5G System Architecture is
extended as shown in Figure 4.2.10-1, Figure 4.2.10-2 and Figure
4.2.10-3. The additional functionality that is supported by the UE and
the network functions shown in these figures is specified in clause 5.32
below. In summary:

\- The UE supports one or more of the steering functionalities specified
in clause 5.32.6, e.g. MPTCP functionality and/or ATSSS-LL
functionality. Each steering functionality in the UE enables traffic
steering, switching and splitting across 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access, in accordance with the ATSSS rules provided by the network. The
ATSSS-LL functionality is mandatory in the UE for MA PDU Session of type
Ethernet.

\- The UPF may support MPTCP Proxy functionality, which communicates
with the MPTCP functionality in the UE by using the MPTCP protocol
(IETF RFC 8684 \[81\]).

\- The UPF may support ATSSS-LL functionality, which is similar to the
ATSSS-LL functionality defined for the UE. There is no user plane
protocol defined between the ATSSS-LL functionality in the UE and the
ATSSS-LL functionality in the UPF. The ATSSS-LL functionality in the UPF
is not shown in the following three figures.

NOTE 1: ATSSS-LL functionality is needed in the 5GC for MA PDU Session
of type Ethernet.

\- In addition, the UPF supports Performance Measurement Functionality
(PMF), which may be used by the UE to obtain access performance
measurements (see clause 5.32.5) over the user-plane of 3GPP access
and/or over the user-plane of non-3GPP access.

\- The AMF, SMF and PCF are extended with new functionality that is
further discussed in clause 5.32.

architecture for ATSSS support

NOTE 2: The interactions between the UE and PCF that may be required for
ATSSS control are specified in TS 23.503 \[45\].

NOTE 3: A UPF that supports the MPTCP Proxy functionality and the PMF
can be connected via an N9 reference point, instead of the N3 reference
point.

Figure 4.2.10-2 shows the 5G System Architecture for ATSSS support in a
roaming case with home-routed traffic and when the UE is registered to
the same VPLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. In this case, the MPTCP
Proxy functionality and the PMF are located in the H-UPF.

registered to different PLMNs). In this case, the MPTCP Proxy
functionality and the PMF are located in the H-UPF.

### 4.2.11 Architecture for 5G multicast-broadcast services

The architecture for 5G multicast-broadcast services is defined in
TS 23.247 \[129\].

### 4.2.12 Architecture for Proximity based Services (ProSe) in 5GS

The architecture for Proximity based Services (ProSe) in the 5G System
is defined in TS 23.304 \[128\].

### 4.2.13 Architecture enhancements for Edge Computing

The architecture enhancements for edge computing are outlined in
clause 5.13 and further described in TS 23.548 \[130\].

### 4.2.14 Architecture for Support of Uncrewed Aerial Systems connectivity, identification and tracking

The architecture for Support of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS)
connectivity, identification and tracking is defined in
TS 23.256 \[136\].

### 4.2.15 Architecture to support WLAN connection using 5G credentials without 5GS registration

The reference architecture shown with reference point representation in
Figure 4.2.15-1 and with Service Based Interface (SBI)-representation in
Figure 4.2.15-2, enables a UE to connect to a WLAN access network using
its 5GS credentials without registration to 5GS. This architecture is
based on the Non-Seamless WLAN Offload Function (NSWOF), which
interfaces to the WLAN access network using the SWa interface as defined
in TS 23.402 \[43\], and interfaces to the AUSF using the Nausf SBI. The
functionality of the NSWOF and the procedures applied for supporting a
WLAN connection using 5GS credentials for Non-seamless WLAN offload are
further defined in TS 33.501 \[29\] Annex S. The roaming architectures
are shown with reference point representation in Figure 4.2.15-3 and
with SBI representation in Figure 4.2.15-4.

The UE can also connect to a WLAN access network using 5GS credentials
by performing the 5GS registration via Trusted non-3GPP access procedure
defined in clause 4.12a.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[03\]. With this procedure,
the UE connects to a WLAN access network using 5GS credentials and
simultaneously registers in 5GS. However, the architecture defined in
Figure 4.2.15-1, Figure 4.2.15-2, Figure 4.2.15-3 and in Figure
4.2.15-4, enables a UE to connect to a WLAN access network using 5GS
credentials but without registration in 5GS.

If the WLAN is configured as Untrusted Non-3GPP access, in the case that
the WLAN supports IEEE 802.1x, the UE may first use the 5G NSWO
procedure to obtain a connection with and the local IP address from the
WLAN, and any time after that, the UE may initiate the Untrusted
Non-3GPP Access to obtain the access to 5GC.

NOTE 1: N26 interface is an inter-CN interface between the MME and 5GS
AMF in order to enable interworking between EPC and the NG core. Support
of N26 interface in the network is optional for interworking. N26
supports subset of the functionalities (essential for interworking) that
are supported over S10.

NOTE 2: PGW-C + SMF and UPF + PGW-U are dedicated for interworking
between 5GS and EPC, which are optional and are based on UE MM Core
Network Capability and UE subscription. UEs that are not subject to 5GS
and EPC interworking may be served by entities not dedicated for
interworking, i.e. by either by PGW or SMF/UPF.

NOTE 3: There can be another UPF (not shown in the figure above) between
the NG-RAN and the UPF + PGW-U, i.e. the UPF + PGW-U can support N9
towards an additional UPF, if needed.

NOTE 4: Figures and procedures in this specification that depict an SGW
make no assumption whether the SGW is deployed as a monolithic SGW or as
an SGW split into its control-plane and user-plane functionality as
described in TS 23.214 \[32\].

### 4.3.5 Service Exposure in Interworking Scenarios

#### 4.3.5.1 Non-roaming architecture

Figure 4.3.5.1-1 shows the non-roaming architecture for Service Exposure
for EPC-5GC Interworking. If the UE is capable of mobility between EPS
and 5GS, the network is expected to associate the UE with an SCEF+NEF
node for Service Capability Exposure.

![](media/image47.emf)

Figure 4.3.5.1 1: Non-roaming Service Exposure Architecture for EPC-5GC
Interworking

NOTE 1: In Figure 4.3.5.1-1, Trust domain for SCEF+NEF is same as Trust
domain for SCEF as defined in TS 23.682 \[36\].

NOTE 2: In Figure 4.3.5.1-1, EPC Interface represents southbound
interfaces between SCEF and EPC nodes e.g. the S6t interface between
SCEF and HSS, the T6a interface between SCEF and MME, etc. All
southbound interfaces from SCEF are defined in TS 23.682 \[36\] and are
not shown for the sake of simplicity.

NOTE 3: In Figure 4.3.5.1-1, 5GC Interface represents southbound
interfaces between NEF and 5GC Network Functions e.g. N29 interface
between NEF and SMF, N30 interface between NEF and PCF, etc. All
southbound interfaces from NEF are not shown for the sake of simplicity.

NOTE 4: Interaction between the SCEF and NEF within the combined
SCEF+NEF is required. For example, when the SCEF+NEF supports monitoring
APIs, the SCEF and NEF need to share context and state information on a
UE\'s configured monitoring events if the UE moves between from EPC and
5GC.

NOTE 5: The north-bound APIs which can be supported by an EPC or 5GC
network are discovered by the SCEF+NEF node via the CAPIF function
and/or via local configuration of the SCEF+NEF node. Different sets of
APIs can be supported by the two network types.

serving AMF is re-allocated for a given UE, the source AMF includes SMSF
identifier as part of UE context transfer to target AMF. If the target
AMF, e.g. in the case of inter-PLMN mobility, detects that no SMSF has
been selected in the serving PLMN, then the AMF performs SMSF selection
as specified in clause 6.3.10.

NOTE 5: To support MT SMS domain selection by IP-SM-GW/SMS Router,
IP-SM-GW/SMS Router may connect to SGs MSC, MME and SMSF via one of the
standardized interfaces as shown in TS 23.040 \[5\].

Figure 4.4.2.1-3 shows the roaming architecture to support SMS over NAS
using the Service-based interfaces within the Control Plane.

#### 4.4.2.2 Reference point to support SMS over NAS

**N1:** Reference point for SMS transfer between UE and AMF via NAS.

Following reference points are realized by service based interfaces:

**N8:** Reference point for SMS Subscription data retrieval between AMF
and UDM.

**N20:** Reference point for SMS transfer between AMF and SMS Function.

**N21:** Reference point for SMS Function address registration
management and SMS Management Subscription data retrieval between SMS
Function and UDM.

#### 4.4.2.3 Service based interface to support SMS over NAS

**Nsmsf:** Service-based interface exhibited by SMSF.

### 4.4.3 IMS support

IMS support for 5GC is defined in TS 23.228 \[15\].

The 5G System architecture supports N5 interface between PCF and P-CSCF
and supports Rx interface between PCF and P-CSCF, to enable IMS service.
See TS 23.228 \[15\], TS 23.503 \[45\] and TS 23.203 \[4\].

NOTE 1: Rx support between PCF and P-CSCF is for backwards compatibility
for early deployments using Diameter between IMS and 5GC functions.

NOTE 2: When service based interfaces are used between the PCF and
P-CSCF in the same PLMN, the P-CSCF performs the functions of a trusted
AF in the 5GC.

### 4.4.4 Location services

#### 4.4.4.1 Architecture to support Location Services

Location Service feature is optional and applicable to both regulatory
services and commercial services in this Release of the specification.
The non-roaming and roaming architecture to support Location Services
are defined in clause 4.2 of TS 23.273 \[87\].

#### 4.4.4.2 Reference point to support Location Services

The reference points to support Location Services are defined in
clause 4.4 of TS 23.273 \[87\].

#### 4.4.4.3 Service Based Interfaces to support Location Services

The Service Based Interfaces to support Location Services are defined in
clause 4.5 of TS 23.273 \[87\].

### 4.4.5 Application Triggering Services

See clause 5.2.6.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Application trigger message contains information that allows the network
to route the message to the appropriate UE and the UE to route the
message to the appropriate application. The information destined to the
application, excluding the information to route it, is referred to as
the Trigger payload. The Trigger payload is implementation specific.

NOTE: The application in the UE may perform actions indicated by the
Trigger payload when the Triggered payload is received at the UE. For
example initiation of immediate or later communication with the
application server based on the information contained in the Trigger
payload, which includes the PDU Session Establishment procedure if the
related PDU Session is not already established.

### 4.4.6 5G LAN-type Services

#### 4.4.6.1 User plane architecture to support 5G LAN-type service

The general User Plane architectures described in clause 4.2.3 and
clause 4.2.4 apply to 5G LAN-type services, with the additional options
described in this clause.

Figure 4.4.6.1-1 depicts the non-roaming user plane architecture to
support 5G LAN-type service using local switch.

#### 4.4.6.2 Reference points to support 5G LAN-type service

**N19:** Reference point between two UPFs for direct routing of traffic
between different PDU Sessions without using N6. It has a per 5G VN
group granularity.

### 4.4.7 MSISDN-less MO SMS Service

MSISDN-less MO SMS via T4 is subscription based. The subscription
provides the information whether a UE is allowed to originate
MSISDN-less MO SMS.

The UE is pre-configured with the Service Centre address that points to
SMS-SC that performs this MO SMS delivery via NEF delivery procedure.
The recipient of this short message is set to the pre-configured address
of the AF (i.e. Address of the destination SME). If UE has multiple
GPSIs associated to the same IMSI, the GPSI that is associated with an
SMS may be determined from the UE\'s IMSI and the Application Port ID
value in the TP-User-Data field (see TS 23.040 \[5\]). The NEF may
obtain the GPSI by querying the UDM with the IMSI and application port
ID.

UE is aware whether the MO SMS delivery status (success or fail) based
on the SMS delivery report from SMS-SC. The network does not perform any
storing and forwarding functionality for MO SMS.

See clause 5.2.6 of TS 23.502 \[3\] for a description of NEF Services
and Service Operations.

### 4.4.8 Architecture to enable Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization

#### 4.4.8.1 General

The 5G System can be extended to support the following:

a\) Integration as a bridge in an IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking
(TSN). The 5GS bridge supports the Time sensitive communication as
defined in IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. The
architecture is described in clause 4.4.8.2.

This Release supports of the specification, integration of the 5G System
with IEEE 802.1 TSN networks that apply the fully centralized
configuration model as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc \[95\]. IEEE TSN is
a set of standards to define mechanisms for the time-sensitive (i.e.
deterministic) transmission of data over Ethernet networks.

b\) Enablers for AF requested support of Time Synchronization and/or
some aspects of Time Sensitive Communication. The architecture is
described in clause 4.4.8.3.

#### 4.4.8.2 Architecture to support IEEE Time Sensitive Networking

The 5G System is integrated with the external network as a TSN bridge.
This \"logical\" TSN bridge (see Figure 4.4.8.2-1) includes TSN
Translator functionality for interoperation between TSN Systems and 5G
System both for user plane and control plane. 5GS TSN translator
functionality consists of Device-side TSN translator (DS-TT) and
Network-side TSN translator (NW-TT). The TSN AF is part of 5GC and
provides the control plane translator functionality for the integration
of the 5GS with a TSN network, e.g. the interactions with the CNC. 5G
System specific procedures in 5GC and RAN, wireless communication links,
etc. remain hidden from the TSN network. To achieve such transparency to
the TSN network and the 5GS to appear as any other TSN Bridge, the 5GS
provides TSN ingress and egress ports via DS-TT and NW-TT. DS-TT and
NW-TT optionally support:

\- hold and forward functionality for the purpose of de-jittering;

\- per-stream filtering and policing as defined in clause 8.6.5.1 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\].

DS-TT optionally supports link layer connectivity discovery and
reporting as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB \[97\] for discovery of
Ethernet devices attached to DS-TT. NW-TT supports link layer
connectivity discovery and reporting as defined in
IEEE Std 802.1AB \[97\] for discovery of Ethernet devices attached to
NW-TT. If a DS-TT does not support link layer connectivity discovery and
reporting, then NW-TT performs link layer connectivity discovery and
reporting as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB \[97\] for discovery of
Ethernet devices attached to DS-TT on behalf of DS-TT.

NOTE 1: If NW-TT performs link layer connectivity discovery and
reporting on behalf of DS-TT, it is assumed that LLDP frames are
transmitted between NW-TT and UE on the QoS Flow with the default QoS
rule as defined in the clause 5.7.1.1. Alternatively, SMF can establish
a dedicated QoS Flow matching on the Ethertype defined for LLDP
(IEEE Std 802.1AB \[97\]).

There are three TSN configuration models defined in
IEEE Std 802.1Qcc \[95\]. Amongst the three models:

\- fully centralized model is supported in this Release of the
specification;

\- fully distributed model is not supported in this Release of the
specification;

\- centralized network/distributed user model is not supported in this
Release of the specification.

NOTE 2: This Release supports interworking with TSN using clause 8.6.8.4
of IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] scheduled traffic and clause 8.6.5.1 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] per-stream filtering and policy.

![](media/image55.emf)

Figure 4.4.8.2-1: System architecture view with 5GS appearing as TSN
bridge

NOTE 3: Whether DS-TT and UE are combined or are separate is up to
implementation.

NOTE 4: TSN AF does not need to support N33 in this release of the
specification.

#### 4.4.8.3 Architecture for AF requested support of Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization

This clause describes the architecture to enable Time Sensitive
Communication AF requested time sensitive communication and time
synchronization services. The Time Sensitive Communication and Time
Synchronization related features that are supported based on AF request
are described in clauses 5.27.1 and 5.27.2, respectively. Figure
4.4.8.3-1 shows the architecture to support Time Sensitive Communication
and Time Synchronization services.

As shown in Figure 4.4.8.3-1, to support Time Synchronization service
based on IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] or IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] for Ethernet
or IP type PDU Sessions, the DS-TT, NW-TT and Time Sensitive
Communication and Time Synchronization Function (TSCTSF) are required in
order to support the features in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] or
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] as described in clause 5.27. The NEF exposes 5GS
capability to support Time Synchronization service as described in
clause 5.27.1.8. TSCTSF controls the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT for the (g)PTP
based time synchronization service. In addition, TSCTSF supports TSC
assistance container related functionalities.

![](media/image56.emf)

Figure 4.4.8.3-1: Architecture to enable Time Sensitive Communication
and Time Synchronization services

NOTE 1: If the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the AF
could interact directly with TSCTSF, the connection between AF and
TSCTSF is not depicted in the architecture diagram for brevity.

UPF/NW-TT distributes the (g)PTP messages as described in clause 5.27.1.

When the UPF supports one or more NW-TT(s), there is one-to-one
association between an NW-TT and the network instance or between an
NW-TT and network instance together with DNN/S-NSSAI in the UPF. When
there are multiple network instances within a UPF, each network instance
is considered logically separate. The network instance for the N6
interface (clause 5.6.12) may be indicated by the SMF to the UPF for a
given PDU Session during PDU Session establishment procedure. UPF
allocates resources based on the Network Instance and S-NSSAI and it is
supported according to TS 29.244 \[65\]. DNN/S-NSSAI may be indicated by
the SMF together with the network instance to the UPF for a given PDU
Session during PDU Session establishment procedure.

NOTE 2: The same NW-TT is used for all PDU Sessions in the UPF for the
given DNN/S-NSSAI; the NW-TT is unique per DNN/S-NSSAI. This ensures
that the UPF selects an N4 session associated with the correct TSCTSF
when the NW-TT initiates an UMIC or PMIC. At any given time, the NW-TT
is associated with a single TSCTSF.

# 5 High level features

## 5.1 General

Clause 5 specifies the high level functionality and features of the 5G
System for both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access and for the interoperability
with the EPC defined in TS 23.401 \[26\].

## 5.2 Network Access Control

### 5.2.1 General

Network access is the means for the user to connect to 5G CN. Network
access control comprises the following functionality:

\- Network selection,

\- Identification and authentication,

\- Authorisation,

\- Access control and barring,

\- Policy control,

\- Lawful Interception.

### 5.2.2 Network selection

In order to determine to which PLMN to attempt registration, the UE
performs network selection. The network selection procedure comprises
two main parts, PLMN selection and access network selection. The
requirements for the PLMN selection are specified in TS 22.011 \[25\]
and the procedures are in TS 23.122 \[17\]. The access network selection
part for the 3GPP access networks is specified in TS 36.300 \[30\] for
E-UTRAN and in TS 38.300 \[27\] for the NR.

The network selection for the Disaster Roaming is described in
TS 23.122 \[17\] and TS 24.501 \[47\].

### 5.2.2a Void

### 5.2.3 Identification and authentication

The network may authenticate the UE during any procedure establishing a
NAS signalling connection with the UE. The security architecture is
specified in TS 33.501 \[29\]. The network may optionally perform an PEI
check with 5G-EIR.

### 5.2.4 Authorisation

The authorisation for connectivity of the subscriber to the 5GC and the
authorization for the services that the user is allowed to access based
on subscription (e.g. Operator Determined Barring, Roaming restrictions,
Access Type and RAT Type currently in use) is evaluated once the user is
successfully identified and authenticated. This authorization is
executed during UE Registration procedure.

### 5.2.5 Access control and barring

When the UE needs to transmit an initial NAS message, the UE shall
request to establish an RRC Connection first and the NAS shall provide
the RRC establishment related information to the lower layer. The RAN
handles the RRC Connection with priority during and after RRC Connection
Establishment procedure, when UE indicates priority in Establishment
related information

Under high network load conditions, the network may protect itself
against overload by using the Unified Access Control functionality for
3GPP access specified in TS 22.261 \[2\], TS 24.501 \[47\] and
TS 38.300 \[27\] to limit access attempts from UEs. Depending on network
configuration, the network may determine whether certain access attempt
should be allowed or blocked based on categorized criteria, as specified
in TS 22.261 \[2\] and TS 24.501 \[47\]. The NG-RAN may broadcast
barring control information associated with Access Categories and Access
Identities as specified in TS 38.300 \[27\].

The NG-RAN node may initiate such Unified Access Control when:

\- AMFs request to restrict the load for UEs that access the network by
sending OVERLOAD START message containing conditions defined in
clause 5.19.5.2, or

\- requested by OAM, or

\- triggered by NG-RAN itself.

If the NG-RAN node takes a decision to initiate UAC because of the
reception of the N2 interface OVERLOAD START messages, the NG-RAN should
only initiate such procedure if all the AMFs relevant to the request
contained in the OVERLOAD START message and connected to this NG-RAN
node request to restrict the load for UEs that access the network.

If the UE supports both N1 and S1 modes NAS and, as defined in
TS 23.401 \[26\], the UE is configured for Extended Access Barring (EAB)
but is not configured with a permission for overriding Extended Access
Barring (EAB), when the UE wants to access the 5GS it shall perform
Unified Access Control checks for Access Category 1 on receiving an
indication from the upper layers as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\],
TS 38.331 \[28\], TS 36.331 \[51\].

If the UE supports both N1 and S1 modes NAS and, as defined in
TS 23.401 \[26\], the UE is configured with a permission for overriding
Extended Access Barring (EAB), when the UE wants to access the 5GS it
shall ignore Unified Access Control checks for Access Category 1 on
receiving an indication from the upper layers, as defined in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

NOTE: UE signalling of Low Access Priority indication over N1 in 5GS is
not supported in this release of the specification.

Operator may provide one or more PLMN-specific Operator-defined access
category definitions to the UE using NAS signalling, and the UE handles
the Operator-defined access category definitions stored for the
Registered PLMN, as specified in TS 24.501 \[47\].

The access control for the Disaster Roaming is described in
TS 23.122 \[17\] and TS 24.501 \[47\].

### 5.2.6 Policy control

Network access control including service authorization may be influenced
by Policy control, as specified in clause 5.14.

### 5.2.7 Lawful Interception

For definition and functionality of Lawful Interception, please see
TS 33.126 \[35\].

## 5.3 Registration and Connection Management

### 5.3.1 General

The Registration Management is used to register or deregister a UE/user
with the network, and establish the user context in the network. The
Connection Management is used to establish and release the signalling
connection between the UE and the AMF.

### 5.3.2 Registration Management

#### 5.3.2.1 General

A UE/user needs to register with the network to receive services that
requires registration. Once registered and if applicable the UE updates
its registration with the network (see TS 23.502 \[3\]):

\- periodically, in order to remain reachable (Periodic Registration
Update); or

\- upon mobility (Mobility Registration Update); or

\- to update its capabilities or re-negotiate protocol parameters
(Mobility Registration Update).

The Initial Registration procedure involves execution of Network Access
Control functions as defined in clause 5.2 (i.e. user authentication and
access authorization based on subscription profiles in UDM). As result
of the Registration procedure, the identifier of the serving AMF serving
the UE in the access through which the UE has registered will be
registered in UDM.

The registration management procedures are applicable over both 3GPP
access and Non-3GPP access. The 3GPP and Non-3GPP RM states are
independent of each other, see clause 5.3.2.4.

#### 5.3.2.2 5GS Registration Management states

##### 5.3.2.2.1 General

Two RM states are used in the UE and the AMF that reflect the
registration status of the UE in the selected PLMN:

\- RM-DEREGISTERED.

\- RM-REGISTERED.

##### 5.3.2.2.2 RM-DEREGISTERED state

In the RM‑DEREGISTERED state, the UE is not registered with the network.
The UE context in AMF holds no valid location or routing information for
the UE so the UE is not reachable by the AMF. However, some parts of UE
context may still be stored in the UE and the AMF e.g. to avoid running
an authentication procedure during every Registration procedure.

In the RM-DEREGISTERED state, the UE shall:

\- attempt to register with the selected PLMN using the Initial
Registration procedure if it needs to receive service that requires
registration (see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

\- remain in RM-DEREGISTERED state if receiving a Registration Reject
upon Initial Registration (see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

\- enter RM-REGISTERED state upon receiving a Registration Accept (see
clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

When the UE RM state in the AMF is RM-DEREGISTERED, the AMF shall:

\- when applicable, accept the Initial Registration of a UE by sending a
Registration Accept to this UE and enter RM-REGISTERED state for the UE
(see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]); or

\- when applicable, reject the Initial Registration of a UE by sending a
Registration Reject to this UE (see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

##### 5.3.2.2.3 RM-REGISTERED state

In the RM‑REGISTERED state, the UE is registered with the network. In
the RM-REGISTERED state, the UE can receive services that require
registration with the network.

In the RM-REGISTERED state, the UE shall:

\- perform Mobility Registration Update procedure if the current TAI of
the serving cell (see TS 37.340 \[31\]) is not in the list of TAIs that
the UE has received from the network in order to maintain the
registration and enable the AMF to page the UE;

NOTE: Additional considerations for Mobility Registration Update in case
of NR satellite access are provided in clause 5.4.11.6.

\- perform Periodic Registration Update procedure triggered by
expiration of the periodic update timer to notify the network that the
UE is still active.

\- perform a Mobility Registration Update procedure to update its
capability information or to re-negotiate protocol parameters with the
network;

\- perform Deregistration procedure (see clause 4.2.2.3.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]), and enter RM-DEREGISTERED state, when the UE needs to
be no longer registered with the PLMN. The UE may decide to deregister
from the network at any time.

\- enter RM-DEREGISTERED state when receiving a Registration Reject
message or a Deregistration message. The actions of the UE depend upon
the cause value\' in the Registration Reject or Deregistration message.
See clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

When the UE RM state in the AMF is RM-REGISTERED, the AMF shall:

\- perform Deregistration procedure (see clauses 4.2.2.3.2, 4.2.2.3.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]), and enter RM-DEREGISTERED state for the UE, when the
UE needs to be no longer registered with the PLMN. The network may
decide to deregister the UE at any time;

\- perform Implicit Deregistration at any time after the Implicit
Deregistration timer expires. The AMF shall enter RM-DEREGISTERED state
for the UE after Implicit Deregistration;

\- when applicable, accept or reject Registration Requests or Service
Requests from the UE.

#### 5.3.2.3 Registration Area management

Registration Area management comprises the functions to allocate and
reallocate a Registration area to a UE. Registration area is managed per
access type i.e. 3GPP access or Non-3GPP access.

When a UE registers with the network over the 3GPP access, the AMF
allocates a set of tracking areas in TAI List to the UE. When the AMF
allocates registration area, i.e. the set of tracking areas in TAI List,
to the UE it may take into account various information (e.g. Mobility
Pattern and Allowed/Non-Allowed Area (refer to clause 5.3.4.1)). An AMF
which has the whole PLMN as serving area may alternatively allocate the
whole PLMN (\"all PLMN\") as registration area to a UE in MICO mode
(refer to clause 5.4.1.3). When AMF allocates registration area for UE
registered for Disaster Roaming service as specified in clause 5.40.4,
AMF shall only consider TAIs covering the area with the Disaster
Condition.

The 5G System shall support allocating a Registration Area using a
single TAI List which includes tracking areas of any NG-RAN nodes in the
Registration Area for a UE.

TAI used for non-3GPP access shall be dedicated to non-3GPP access.
TAI(s) dedicated to Non-3GPP access may be defined in a PLMN and apply
within this PLMN. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF is locally configured
with one TAI value. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF may be configured
with a different TAI value or with the same TAI value as other N3IWFs,
TNGFs, TWIFs and/or W-AGFs. The TAI is provided to the AMF during N2
interface setup as described in TS 38.413 \[34\].

When a UE registers with the network over a Non-3GPP access, the AMF
allocates to the UE a registration area that only includes the TAI
received from the serving N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF.

NOTE 1: For example, two W-AGFs can each correspond to a different TAI
(one TAI per W-AGF) and thus support different sets of S-NSSAI(s).

When generating the TAI list, the AMF shall include only TAIs that are
applicable on the access type (i.e. 3GPP access or Non-3GPP access)
where the TAI list is sent.

NOTE 2: To prevent extra signalling load resulting from Mobility
Registration Update occurring at every RAT change, it is preferable to
avoid generating a RAT-specific TAI list for a UE supporting more than
one RAT.

NOTE 3: For a UE registered on N3GPP access the TAI(s) provided to the
UE as part of the Registration Area is expected to enable the support of
the slices that are intended to be provided for this UE over this
specific Non-3GPP access. In addition, the Registration Area provided to
the UE for non-3GPP access will never change until the UE deregisters
from non-3GPP access (either explicit deregistration or implicit
deregistration due to Deregistration timer expiring due to UE entering
CM_IDLE state).

For all 3GPP Access RATs in NG-RAN and for Non-3GPP Access, the 5G
System supports the TAI format as specified in TS 23.003 \[19\]
consisting of MCC, MNC and a 3-byte TAC only.

The additional aspects for registration management when a UE is
registered over one access type while the UE is already registered over
the other access type is further described in clause 5.3.2.4.

To ensure a UE initiates a Mobility Registration procedure when
performing inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT, a Tracking Area shall
not contain both NB-IoT and other RATs cells (e.g. WB-E-UTRA, NR), and
the AMF shall not allocate a TAI list that contains both NB-IoT and
other RATs Tracking Areas.

For 3GPP access the AMF determines the RAT type the UE is camping on
based on the Global RAN Node IDs associated with the N2 interface and
additionally the Tracking Area indicated by NG-RAN. When the UE is
accessing NR using unlicensed bands, as defined in clause 5.4.8, an
indication is provided in N2 interface as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\].

The AMF may also determine more precise RAT Type information based on
further information received from NG-RAN:

\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be LTE-M as defined in
clause 5.31.20; or

\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be NR using unlicensed bands,
as defined in clause 5.4.8.

\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be one of the RAT types for
satellite access, as defined in clause 5.4.10.

\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be NR RedCap as defined in
clause 5.41.

For Non-3GPP accesses the AMF determines the RAT type the UE is camping
based on the 5G-AN node associated with N2 interface as follows:

\- The RAT type is Untrusted Non-3GPP if the 5G-AN node has a Global
N3IWF Node ID;

\- The RAT type is Trusted Non-3GPP if the 5G-AN node has a Global TNGF
Node ID or a Global TWIF Node ID; and

\- The RAT type is Wireline -BBF if the 5G-AN node has a Global W-AGF
Node ID corresponding to a W-AGF supporting the Wireline BBF Access
Network. The RAT type is Wireline-Cable if the 5G-AN node has a Global
W-AGF Node ID corresponding to a W-AGF supporting the Wireline Cable
Access Network. If not possible to distinguish between the two, the RAT
type is Wireline.

NOTE 4: How to differentiate between W-AGF supporting either Wireline
BBF Access Network or the Wireline (e.g. different Global W-AGF Node ID
IE or the Global W-AGF Node ID including a field to distinguish between
them) is left to Stage 3 definition.

NOTE 5: If an operator supports only one kind of Wireline Access Network
(either Wireline BBF Access Network or a Wireline Cable Access Network)
the AMF may be configured to use RAT type Wireline or the specific one.

For Non-3GPP access the AMF may also use the User Location Information
provided at N2 connection setup to determine a more precise RAT Type,
e.g. identifying IEEE 802.11 access, Wireline-Cable access, Wireline-BBF
access.

When the 5G-AN node has either a Global N3IWF Node ID, or a Global TNGF
Node ID, or a Global TWIF Node ID, or a Global W-AGF Node ID, the Access
Type is Non-3GPP Access.

#### 5.3.2.4 Support of a UE registered over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access

This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the
Untrusted Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP and to the
W-5GAN. In the case of W-5GAN the UE mentioned in this clause
corresponds to the 5G-RG.

For a given serving PLMN there is one RM context for a UE for each
access, e.g. when the UE is consecutively or simultaneously served by a
3GPP access and by a non-3GPP access (i.e. via an N3IWF, TNGF and W-AGF)
of the same PLMN. UDM manages separate/independent UE Registration
procedures for each access.

When served by the same PLMN for 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, an UE is
served by the same AMF except in the temporary situation described in
clause 5.17 i.e. after a mobility from EPS while the UE has PDU Sessions
associated with non-3GPP access.

The 5G NSWO authentication as defined in Annex S of TS 33.501 \[29\]
does not impact the RM state.

An AMF associates multiple access-specific RM contexts for an UE with:

\- a 5G-GUTI that is common to both 3GPP and Non-3GPP accesses. This
5G-GUTI is globally unique.

\- a Registration state per access type (3GPP / Non-3GPP)

\- a Registration Area per access type: one Registration Area for 3GPP
access and another Registration Area for non 3GPP access. Registration
Areas for the 3GPP access and the Non-3GPP access are independent.

\- timers for 3GPP access:

\- a Periodic Registration timer; and

\- a Mobile Reachable timer and an Implicit Deregistration timer.

\- timers for non-3GPP access:

\- a UE Non-3GPP Deregistration timer; and

\- a Network Non-3GPP Implicit Deregistration timer.

The AMF shall not provide a Periodic Registration Timer for the UE over
a Non-3GPP access. Consequently, the UE need not perform Periodic
Registration Update procedure over Non-3GPP access. Instead, during the
Initial Registration procedure and Re-registration, the UE is provided
by the network with a UE Non-3GPP Deregistration timer that starts when
the UE enters non-3GPP CM-IDLE state.

When the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access for the same UE are served
by the same PLMN, the AMF assigns the same 5G-GUTI for use over both
accesses. Such a 5G-GUTI may be assigned or re-assigned over any of the
3GPP and Non-3GPP accesses. The 5G-GUTI is assigned upon a successful
registration of the UE, and is valid over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access
to the same PLMN for the UE. Upon performing an initial access over the
Non-3GPP access or over the 3GPP access while the UE is already
registered with the 5G System over another access of the same PLMN, the
UE provides the native 5G-GUTI for the other access. This enables the AN
to select an AMF that maintains the UE context created at the previous
Registration procedure via the GUAMI derived from the 5G-GUTI, and
enables the AMF to correlate the UE request to the existing UE context
via the 5G-GUTI.

If the UE is performing registration over one access and intends to
perform registration over the other access in the same PLMN (e.g. the
3GPP access and the selected N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF are located in the
same PLMN), the UE shall not initiate the registration over the other
access until the Registration procedure over first access is completed.

NOTE: To which access the UE performs registration first is up to UE
implementation.

When the UE is successfully registered to an access (3GPP access or
Non-3GPP access respectively) and the UE registers via the other access:

\- if the second access is located in the same PLMN (e.g. the UE is
registered via a 3GPP access and selects a N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF located
in the same PLMN), the UE shall use for the registration to the PLMN
associated with the new access the 5G-GUTI that the UE has been provided
with at the previous registration or UE configuration update procedure
for the first access in the same PLMN. Upon successful completion of the
registration to the second access, if the network included a 5G-GUTI in
the Registration Accept, the UE shall use the 5G-GUTI received in the
Registration Accept for both registrations. If no 5G-GUTI is included in
the Registration Accept, then the UE uses the 5G-GUTI assigned for the
existing registration also for the new registration.

\- if the second access is located in a PLMN different from the
registered PLMN of the first access (i.e. not the registered PLMN),
(e.g. the UE is registered to a 3GPP access and selects a N3IWF, TNGF or
W-AGF located in a PLMN different from the PLMN of the 3GPP access, or
the UE is registered over Non-3GPP and registers to a 3GPP access in a
PLMN different from the PLMN of the N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF), the UE shall
use for the registration to the PLMN associated with the new access a
5G-GUTI only if it has got one previously received from a PLMN that is
not the same as the PLMN the UE is already registered with. If the UE
does not include a 5G-GUTI, the SUCI shall be used for the new
registration. Upon successful completion of the registration to the
second access, the UE has the two 5G-GUTIs (one per PLMN).

A UE supporting registration over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access to two
PLMNs shall be able to handle two separate registrations, including two
5G-GUTIs, one per PLMN, and two associated equivalent PLMN lists.

When a UE 5G-GUTI assigned during a Registration procedure over 3GPP
(e.g. the UE registers first over a 3GPP access) is location-dependent,
the same UE 5G-GUTI can be re-used over the Non-3GPP access when the
selected N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF function is in the same PLMN as the 3GPP
access. When an UE 5G-GUTI is assigned during a Registration procedure
performed over a Non 3GPP access (e.g. the UE registers first over a
non-3GPP access), the UE 5G-GUTI may not be location-dependent, so that
the UE 5G-GUTI may not be valid for NAS procedures over the 3GPP access
and, in this case, a new AMF is allocated during the Registration
procedure over the 3GPP access.

When the UE is registered first via 3GPP access, if the UE registers to
the same PLMN via Non-3GPP access, the UE shall send the GUAMI obtained
via 3GPP access to the N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF, which uses the received
GUAMI to select the same AMF as the 3GPP access.

The Deregistration Request message indicates whether it applies to the
3GPP access the Non-3GPP access, or both.

If the UE is registered on both 3GPP and Non-3GPP accesses and it is in
CM-IDLE over Non-3GPP access, then the UE or AMF may initiate a
Deregistration procedure over the 3GPP access to deregister the UE only
on the Non-3GPP access, in which case all the PDU Sessions which are
associated with the Non-3GPP access shall be released.

If the UE is registered on both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and it is in
CM-IDLE over 3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED over non-3GPP access, then
the UE may initiate a Deregistration procedure over the non-3GPP access
to deregister the UE only on the 3GPP access, in which case all the PDU
Sessions which are associated with the 3GPP access shall be released.

Registration Management over Non-3GPP access is further defined in
clause 5.5.1.

### 5.3.3 Connection Management

#### 5.3.3.1 General

Connection management comprises the functions of establishing and
releasing a NAS signalling connection between a UE and the AMF over N1.
This NAS signalling connection is used to enable NAS signalling exchange
between the UE and the core network. It comprises both the AN signalling
connection between the UE and the AN (RRC Connection over 3GPP access or
UE-N3IWF connection over untrusted N3GPP access or UE-TNGF connection
over trusted N3GPP access) and the N2 connection for this UE between the
AN and the AMF.

#### 5.3.3.2 5GS Connection Management states

##### 5.3.3.2.1 General

Two CM states are used to reflect the NAS signalling Connection of the
UE with the AMF:

\- CM-IDLE

\- CM-CONNECTED

The CM state for 3GPP access and Non-3GPP access are independent of each
other, i.e. one can be in CM-IDLE state at the same time when the other
is in CM-CONNECTED state.

##### 5.3.3.2.2 CM-IDLE state

A UE in CM-IDLE state has no NAS signalling connection established with
the AMF over N1. The UE performs cell selection/cell reselection
according to TS 38.304 \[50\] and PLMN selection according to
TS 23.122 \[17\].

There are no AN signalling connection, N2 connection and N3 connections
for the UE in the CM-IDLE state.

If the UE is both in CM-IDLE state and in RM-REGISTERED state, the UE
shall, unless otherwise specified in clause 5.3.4.1:

\- Respond to paging by performing a Service Request procedure (see
clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), unless the UE is in MICO mode (see
clause 5.4.1.3);

\- perform a Service Request procedure when the UE has uplink signalling
or user data to be sent (see clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).
Specific conditions apply for LADN, see clause 5.6.5.

When the UE state in the AMF is RM-REGISTERED, UE information required
for initiating communication with the UE shall be stored. The AMF shall
be able to retrieve stored information required for initiating
communication with the UE using the 5G-GUTI.

NOTE: In 5GS there is no need for paging using the SUPI/SUCI of the UE.

The UE provides 5G-S-TMSI as part of AN parameters during AN signalling
connection establishment as specified in TS 38.331 \[28\] and
TS 36.331 \[51\]. The UE shall enter CM-CONNECTED state whenever an AN
signalling connection is established between the UE and the AN (entering
RRC Connected state over 3GPP access, or at the establishment of the
UE-N3IWF connectivity over untrusted non-3GPP access or the UE-TNGF
connectivity over trusted non-3GPP access). The transmission of an
Initial NAS message (Registration Request, Service Request or
Deregistration Request) initiates the transition from CM-IDLE to
CM-CONNECTED state.

When the UE states in the AMF are CM-IDLE and RM-REGISTERED, the AMF
shall:

\- perform a network triggered Service Request procedure when it has
signalling or mobile-terminated data to be sent to this UE, by sending a
Paging Request to this UE (see clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), if a
UE is not prevented from responding e.g. due to MICO mode or Mobility
Restrictions.

The AMF shall enter CM-CONNECTED state for the UE whenever an N2
connection is established for this UE between the AN and the AMF. The
reception of initial N2 message (e.g. N2 INITIAL UE MESSAGE) initiates
the transition of AMF from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED state.

The UE and the AMF may optimize the power efficiency and signalling
efficiency of the UE when in CM-IDLE state e.g. by activating MICO mode
(see clause 5.4.1.3).

##### 5.3.3.2.3 CM-CONNECTED state

A UE in CM-CONNECTED state has a NAS signalling connection with the AMF
over N1. A NAS signalling connection uses an RRC Connection between the
UE and the NG-RAN and an NGAP UE association between the AN and the AMF
for 3GPP access. A UE can be in CM-CONNECTED state with an NGAP UE
association that is not bound to any TNLA between the AN and the AMF.
See clause 5.21.1.2 for details on the state of NGAP UE association for
an UE in CM-CONNECTED state. Upon completion of a NAS signalling
procedure, the AMF may decide to release the NAS signalling connection
with the UE.

In the CM-CONNECTED state, the UE shall:

\- enter CM-IDLE state whenever the AN signalling connection is released
(entering RRC Idle state over 3GPP access or when the release of the
UE-N3IWF connectivity over untrusted non-3GPP access or the UE-TNGF
connectivity over trusted non-3GPP access is detected by the UE), see
TS 38.331 \[28\] for 3GPP access.

When the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-CONNECTED, the AMF shall:

\- enter CM-IDLE state for the UE whenever the logical NGAP signalling
connection and the N3 user plane connection for this UE are released
upon completion of the AN Release procedure as specified in
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AMF may keep a UE CM state in the AMF in CM-CONNECTED state until
the UE de-registers from the core network.

A UE in CM-CONNECTED state can be in RRC Inactive state, see
TS 38.300 \[27\]. When the UE is in RRC Inactive state the following
applies:

\- UE reachability is managed by the RAN, with assistance information
from core network;

\- UE paging is managed by the RAN.

\- UE monitors for paging with UE\'s CN (5G S-TMSI) and RAN identifier.

Figure 5.3.3.2.4-1: CM state transition in UE

![](media/image60.emf)

Figure 5.3.3.2.4-2: CM state transition in AMF

When a UE enters CM-IDLE state, the UP connection of the PDU Sessions
that were active on this access are deactivated.

NOTE: The activation of UP connection of PDU Sessions is documented in
clause 5.6.8.

##### 5.3.3.2.5 CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state

RRC Inactive state applies to NG-RAN. UE support for RRC Inactive state
is defined in TS 38.306 \[69\] for NR and TS 36.306 \[70\] for E-UTRA
connected to 5GC. RRC Inactive is not supported by NB-IoT connected to
5GC.

The AMF shall provide assistance information to the NG-RAN, to assist
the NG-RAN\'s decision whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state
except due to some exceptional cases such as:

\- PLMN (or AMF set) does not support RRC Inactive;

\- The UE needs to be kept in CM-CONNECTED State (e.g. for tracking).

The \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\" includes:

\- UE specific DRX values;

\- UE specific extended idle mode DRX values (cycle length and Paging
Time Window length);

\- The Registration Area provided to the UE;

\- Periodic Registration Update timer;

\- If the AMF has enabled MICO mode for the UE, an indication that the
UE is in MICO mode;

\- Information from the UE identifier, as defined in TS 38.304 \[50\]
for NR and TS 36.304 \[52\] for E-UTRA connected to 5GC, that allows the
RAN to calculate the UE\'s RAN paging occasions;

\- An indication that Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service is
supported;

\- AMF PEIPS Assistance Information (see clause 5.4.12.2) for paging a
UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state over NR as defined in
TS 38.300 \[27\].

The RRC Inactive Assistance Information mentioned above is provided by
the AMF during N2 activation with the (new) serving NG-RAN node (i.e.
during Registration, Service Request, Handover) to assist the NG RAN\'s
decision whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state. If the AMF
allocates a new Registration Area to the UE, the AMF should update the
NG-RAN with the new Registration Area by sending the RRC Inactive
Assistance Information accordingly. The Paging Cause Indication for
Voice Service is used to assist NG RAN to perform RAN based paging.

RRC Inactive state is part of RRC state machine, and it is up to the RAN
to determine the conditions to enter RRC Inactive state. If any of the
parameters included in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information changes
as the result of NAS procedure, the AMF shall update the RRC Inactive
Assistance Information to the NG-RAN node.

When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, if the AMF has provided RRC
Inactive assistance information, the RAN node may decide to move a UE to
CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state.

The state and \"endpoints\" (in the case of Dual Connectivity
configuration) of the N2 and N3 reference points are not changed by the
UE entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state. A UE in RRC inactive
state is aware of the RAN Notification area and periodic RAN
Notification Area Update timer.

The 5GC network is not aware of the UE transitions between CM-CONNECTED
with RRC Connected and CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, unless the
5GC network is notified via N2 notification procedure in clause 4.8.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

At transition into CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN
configures the UE with a periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer
taking into account the value of the Periodic Registration Update timer
value indicated in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information, and uses a
guard timer with a value longer than the RAN Notification Area Update
timer value provided to the UE.

If the periodic RAN Notification Area Update guard timer expires in
NG-RAN, the NG-RAN shall initiate AN Release procedure as specified in
clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE performs
PLMN selection procedures as defined in TS 23.122 \[17\] and
TS 24.501 \[47\].

When the UE is CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE may resume
the RRC Connection due to:

\- Uplink data pending;

\- Mobile initiated NAS signalling procedure;

\- As a response to RAN paging;

\- Notifying the network that it has left the RAN Notification Area;

\- Upon periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer expiration.

If the UE resumes the connection in a different NG-RAN node within the
same PLMN or equivalent PLMN, the UE AS context is retrieved from the
old NG-RAN node and a procedure is triggered towards the CN (see
clause 4.8.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

NOTE 1: With Dual Connectivity configuration if the UE resumes the RRC
connection in the Master RAN node, the Secondary RAN node configuration
is defined in TS 38.300 \[27\].

If the RAN paging procedure, as defined in TS 38.300 \[27\], is not
successful in establishing contact with the UE the procedure shall be
handled by the network as follows:

\- If NG-RAN has at least one pending NAS PDU for transmission, the RAN
node shall initiate the AN Release procedure (see clause 4.2.6 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]) to move the UE CM state in the AMF to CM-IDLE state and
indicate to the AMF the NAS non-delivery.

\- If NG RAN has only pending user plane data for transmission, the
NG-RAN node may keep the N2 connection active or initiate the AN Release
procedure (see clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) based on local
configuration in NG-RAN.

NOTE 2: The user plane data which triggers the RAN paging can be lost,
e.g. in the case of RAN paging failure.

If a UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state performs cell selection
to GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, it shall follow idle mode procedures of the
selected RAT as specified in clause 5.17.

In addition, a UE in CM-CONNECTED state with RRC Inactive state shall
enter CM-IDLE state and initiates the NAS signalling recovery (see
TS 24.501 \[47\]) in the following cases:

\- If RRC resume procedure fails,

If the UE receives Core Network paging,

\- If the periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer expires and the UE
cannot successfully resume the RRC Connection,

\- In any other failure scenario that cannot be resolved in RRC Inactive
state and requires the UE to move to CM-IDLE state.

When a UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, and a trigger to
change the UE\'s NG-RAN or E‑UTRAN UE Radio Capability information
happens, the UE shall move to CM-IDLE state and initiate the procedure
for updating UE Radio Capability defined in clause 5.4.4.1. (For
specific requirements for a UE operating in dual-registration mode see
clause 5.17.2.1)

When UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if RAN has received
Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type
indicating single stand-alone report or continuously reporting whenever
the UE changes the cell, the RAN shall perform .location reporting as
specified in clause 4.10 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

When the UE is CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state. If the AMF receives
Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification from UDM, the AMF shall initiate AN
Release procedure as specified in clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

When UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if RAN has received
Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type of
the Area Of Interest based reporting, the RAN shall send a Location
Report message to AMF including UE presence in the Area Of Interest
(i.e. IN, OUT, or UNKNOWN) and the UE\'s last known location with time
stamp.

When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if the old
NG-RAN node that sents the UE into RRC Inactive state receives the
downlink N2 signalling, it initiates the RAN paging as defined in
TS 38.300 \[27\]. If the UE resumes the RRC Connection towards a
different NG-RAN node, the old NG-RAN node includes the \"UE Context
Transfer\" indication into a response container to the NF (e.g. AMF or
SMF) that generates such N2 downlink signalling. Then the NF shall
reattempt the same procedure when the path switch from the old NG-RAN
node to the new NG-RAN node is complete.

#### 5.3.3.3 NAS signalling connection management

##### 5.3.3.3.1 General

NAS signalling connection management includes the functions of
establishing and releasing a NAS signalling connection.

##### 5.3.3.3.2 NAS signalling connection establishment

NAS signalling connection establishment function is provided by the UE
and the AMF to establish a NAS signalling connection for a UE in CM-IDLE
state. The AMF shall provide the list of recommended cells/ TAs / NG-RAN
node identifiers for paging, if the NG-RAN had provided that information
in an earlier AN Release Procedure in the AN (see clause 4.2.6 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]).

When the UE in CM-IDLE state needs to transmit an NAS message, the UE
shall initiate a Service Request, a Registration or a Deregistration
procedure to establish a NAS signalling connection to the AMF as
specified in clauses 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. If the NAS
signalling connection is to be established via an NG-RAN node, but the
AMF detects that this UE has already established a NAS signalling
connection via old NG-RAN node, the AMF shall release the old
established NAS signalling connection by triggering AN Release
Procedure.

Based on UE preferences, UE subscription, Mobility Pattern and network
configuration, the AMF may keep the NAS signalling connection until the
UE de-registers from the network.

##### 5.3.3.3.3 NAS signalling connection Release

The procedure of releasing a NAS signalling connection is initiated by
the AN node (either 5G (R)AN node or N3IWF) or the AMF. The NG-RAN node
may include the list of recommended cells/ TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers
for paging, during the AN Release Procedure in the AN (see clause 4.2.6
of TS 23.502 \[3\]). The AMF stores this information, if provided by the
NG-RAN.

The UE considers the NAS signalling connection is released if it detects
the AN signalling connection is released. The AMF considers the NAS
signalling connection is released if it detects the N2 context is
released.

#### 5.3.3.4 Support of a UE connected over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access

The AMF manages two CM states for an UE: a CM state for 3GPP access and
a CM state for Non-3GPP access. An N2 interface can serve the UE for
either 3GPP access or for Non 3GPP access. UE connected over both 3GPP
and Non-3GPP has got two N2 interfaces, one for each access. A UE may be
in any combination of the CM states between 3GPP and Non-3GPP access,
e.g. a UE may be CM-IDLE for one access and CM-CONNECTED for the other
access, CM-IDLE for both accesses or CM-CONNECTED for both accesses.

When the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE for 3GPP access and
CM-CONNECTED for Non-3GPP access, the AMF shall perform a network
triggered Service Request procedure, when it has downlink data to be
sent to this UE for 3GPP access, by sending either the Paging Request
via 3GPP access or the NAS notification via Non-3GPP access to this UE
(see clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

Connection Management over Non-3GPP access is further defined in
clause 5.5.2.

### 5.3.4 UE Mobility

#### 5.3.4.1 Mobility Restrictions

##### 5.3.4.1.1 General

Mobility Restrictions restrict mobility handling or service access of a
UE. The Mobility Restriction functionality is provided by the UE (only
for mobility restriction categories provided to the UE), the radio
access network and the core network.

Unless otherwise stated, Mobility Restrictions only apply to 3GPP access
and wireline access, they do not apply to other non-3GPP accesses.

The UE and the network shall override Mobility restriction as specified
in clause 5.16.4.3 when accessing the network for Emergency Services.
For MPS and MCX, service area restriction does not apply, as specified
in TS 24.501 \[47\].

For UE requesting Disaster Roaming service, the UE is only allowed to
receive services in the area with Disaster Condition as specified in
clause 5.40.4. The other areas within the PLMN shall be considered as
forbidden area for the UE registered for Disaster Roaming service.

Service Area restrictions and handling of Forbidden Areas for CM-IDLE
state and, for CM-CONNECTED state when in RRC Inactive state are
executed by the UE based on information received from the core network.
Mobility Restrictions for CM-CONNECTED state when in RRC-Connected state
are executed by the radio access network and the core network.

In CM-CONNECTED state, the core network provides Mobility Restrictions
to the radio access network within Mobility Restriction List.

Mobility Restrictions consists of RAT restriction, Forbidden Area,
Service Area Restrictions, Core Network type restriction and Closed
Access Group information as follows:

\- RAT restriction:

Defines the 3GPP Radio Access Technology(ies), a UE is not allowed to
access in a PLMN. In a restricted RAT a UE based on subscription is not
permitted access to the network for this PLMN. For CM-CONNECTED state,
when radio access network determines target RAT and target PLMN during
Handover procedure, it should take per PLMN RAT restriction into
consideration. The RAT restriction is enforced in the network, and not
provided to the UE.

\- Forbidden Area:

In a Forbidden Area, the UE, based on subscription, is not permitted to
initiate any communication with the network for this PLMN. The UE
behaviour in terms of cell selection, RAT selection and PLMN selection
depends on the network response that informs the UE of Forbidden Area. A
Forbidden Area applies either to 3GPP access or to non-3GPP access.

Further description on Forbidden Area when using wireline access is
available in TS 23.316 \[84\].

Support for Forbidden Area with NR satellite access is described in
clause 5.4.11.8.

Forbidden Areas should not be used for Untrusted or Trusted non-3GPP
access.

NOTE 1: If a UE receives that the UE is accessing from a forbidden
tracking area when registering over untrusted non-3GPP access or trusted
non-3GPP access, the UE cannot determine the corresponding TAI and thus
needs to consider that access to untrusted non-3GPP access and to
trusted non-3GPP access in this PLMN is forbidden until the forbidden
area list is removed as described in TS 24.501 \[47\].

NOTE 2: The UE reactions to specific network responses are described in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

\- Service Area Restriction:

Defines areas in which the UE may or may not initiate communication with
the network as follows:

\- Allowed Area:

In an Allowed Area, the UE is permitted to initiate communication with
the network as allowed by the subscription.

\- Non-Allowed Area:

In a Non-Allowed Area a UE is service area restricted based on
subscription. The UE and the network are not allowed to initiate Service
Request, or any connection requests for user plane data, control plane
data, exception data reporting, or SM signalling (except for PS Data Off
status change reporting) to obtain user services that are not related to
mobility.

The UE shall not use the entering of a Non-Allowed Area as a criterion
for Cell Reselection, a trigger for PLMN Selection or Domain selection
for UE originating sessions or calls. The RRC procedures while the UE is
in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state are unchanged compared to when
the UE is in an Allowed Area. The RM procedures are unchanged compared
to when the UE is in an Allowed Area. The UE in a Non-Allowed Area shall
respond to core network paging or NAS Notification message from non-3GPP
access with Service Request and RAN paging. The UE in a Non-Allowed Area
may initiate MA PDU Session establishment or activation over a non-3GPP
access other than wireline access, but the User Plane resources on the
3GPP access for the MA-PDU shall not be established or activated. The
handling of Non-Allowed Area when using wireline access is described in
TS 23.316 \[84\].

NOTE 3: When the services are restricted in 5GS due to Service Area
Restriction, then it is assumed that the services will be also
restricted in all RATs/Systems at the same location(s) using appropriate
mechanisms available in the other RATs/Systems.

NOTE 4: Delivery of SOR transparent container, UE policy container, UE
parameters update transparent container as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\],
or removal of any stored Paging Restriction Information from network via
Registration Request (see clause 5.38), is part of the mobility related
service and is allowed in an area with service restriction.

NOTE 5: For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state then neither control plane data
transmission nor, if user plane resources are already established, user
plane data transmission are restricted by a non-allowed area.

\- Core Network type restriction:

Defines whether UE is allowed to connect to 5GC only, EPC only, both 5GC
and EPC for this PLMN. The Core Network type restriction when received
applies in the PLMN either to both 3GPP and non-3GPP Access Types or to
non-3GPP Access Type only.

NOTE 6: The Core Network type restriction can be used e.g. in network
deployments where the E-UTRAN connects to both EPC and 5GC as described
in clause 5.17. When the Core Network type restriction applies to
non-3GPP Access Type, the UE is restricted from using any connectivity
to an N3IWF.

\- Closed Access Group information:

As defined in clause 5.30.3.

For a given UE, the core network determines the Mobility Restrictions
based on UE subscription information, UE location and/or local policy
(e.g. if the HPLMN has not deployed 5GC, HPLMN ID of the UE and the
operator\'s policy are used in the VPLMN for determining the Core
Network type restriction). The Mobility Restriction may change due to
e.g. UE\'s subscription, location change and local policy. Optionally
the Service Area Restrictions or the Non-Allowed Area may in addition be
fine-tuned by the PCF e.g. based on UE location, PEI and network
policies. Service Area Restrictions may be updated during a Registration
procedure or UE Configuration Update procedure.

NOTE 7: The subscription management ensures that for MPS service
subscriber the Mobility Restrictions is not included.

If the network sends Service Area Restrictions to the UE, the network
sends only either an Allowed Area, or a Non-Allowed Area, but not both
at the same time, to the UE. If the UE has received an Allowed Area from
the network, any TA not part of the Allowed Area is considered by the UE
as non-allowed. If the UE has received a Non-Allowed Area from the
network, any TA not part of the Non-Allowed Area is considered by the UE
as allowed. If the UE has not received any Service Area Restrictions,
any TA in the PLMN is considered as allowed.

If the UE has overlapping areas between Forbidden Areas, Service Area
Restrictions, or any combination of them, the UE shall proceed in the
following precedence order:

\- The evaluation of Forbidden Areas shall take precedence over the
evaluation of Service Area Restrictions.

The UDM shall provide to the AMF the information defined in
TS 23.008 \[119\] about the subscriber\'s NR or E-UTRA access
restriction set by the operator determined e.g. by subscription scenario
and roaming scenario:

\- For NR:

\- NR not allowed as primary access.

\- NR not allowed as secondary access.

\- NR in unlicensed bands not allowed as primary access.

\- NR in unlicensed bands not allowed as secondary access.

\- NR(LEO) satellite access not allowed as primary access.

\- NR(MEO) satellite access not allowed as primary access.

\- NR(GEO) satellite access not allowed as primary access.

\- NR(OTHERSAT) satellite access not allowed as primary access.

\- NR RedCap not allowed as primary access.

Editor\'s note: The final decision on whether Dual Connectivity and
Carrier Aggregation are supported is in RAN WG2 and RAN WG3.
Subsequently SA WG2 will consider whether any system features are needed
to support such DC or CA RAN functionality such as mobility restrictions
for secondary access.

\- For E-UTRA:

\- E-UTRA not allowed as primary access.

\- E-UTRA not allowed as secondary access.

\- E-UTRA in unlicensed bands not allowed as secondary access.

\- NB-IoT not allowed as primary access.

\- LTE-M not allowed as primary access.

In order to enforce all primary access restrictions, the related access
has to be deployed in different Tracking Area Codes and the subscriber
shall not be allowed to access the network in TAs using the particular
access.

With all secondary access restrictions, the subscriber shall not be
allowed to use this access as secondary access.

##### 5.3.4.1.2 Management of Service Area Restrictions

This clause describes Service Area Restrictions for 3GPP access. For
Service Area Restrictions when using wireline access, see
TS 23.316 \[84\].

A Service Area Restriction may contain one or more (e.g. up to 16)
entire Tracking Areas each or the Service Area Restriction may be set as
unlimited (i.e. contain all Tracking Areas of the PLMN). The UE\'s
subscription data in the UDM includes a Service Area Restriction which
may contain either Allowed or Non-Allowed Areas--specified by using
explicit Tracking Area identities and/or other geographical information
(e.g. longitude/latitude, zip code, etc). The geographical information
used to specify Allowed or Non-Allowed Area is only managed in the
network, and the network will map it to a list of TAs before sending
Service Area Restriction information to the PCF, NG-RAN and UE.

When the AMF assigns a limited allowed area to the UE, the AMF shall
provide the UE with Service Area Restrictions which consist of either
Allowed Areas or Non-Allowed Areas. The Allowed Areas included in the
Service Area Restrictions can be pre-configured and/or dynamically
assigned by the AMF.

The Allowed Area may alternatively be configured as unlimited i.e. it
may contain all Tracking Areas of the PLMN. The Registration Area of a
UE in the Non-Allowed Area should consist of a set of TAs which belongs
to a Non-Allowed Area of the UE. The Registration Area of a UE in the
Allowed Area should consist of a set of TAs which belongs to an Allowed
Area of the UE. The AMF provides the Service Area Restriction in the
form of TA(s), which may be a subset of full list stored in UE\'s
subscription data or provided by the PCF, to the UE during the
Registration procedure.

NOTE: As the finest granularity for Service Area Restrictions are at TA
level, subscriptions with limited geographical extent, like
subscriptions for Fixed Wireless Access, will be allocated one or a few
TAs and will consequently be allowed to access services in a larger area
than in e.g. a FWA system.

The limited allowed area may also be limited by the AMF by a maximum
allowed number of Tracking Areas, even though this limitation is not
sent to the UE. If maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas is used in
combination with Allowed Area, the maximum allowed number of Tracking
Areas indicates (to the AMF) the maximum number of TAs allowed in
limited allowed area inside the Allowed Area. If maximum allowed number
of Tracking Areas is used in combination with Non-Allowed Area, the
maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas indicates (to the AMF) the
maximum number of TAs allowed in limited allowed area outside of the
Non-Allowed Area.

The UDM stores the Service Area Restrictions of a UE as part of the
UE\'s subscription data. The PCF in the serving network may (e.g. due to
varying conditions such as UE\'s location, application in use, time and
date) further adjust Service Area Restrictions of a UE, either by
expanding an Allowed Area or by reducing a Non-Allowed Area or by
increasing the maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas. If NWDAF is
deployed, the PCF may use analytics (i.e. statistics or predictions) on
UE mobility from NWDAF (see TS 23.288 \[86\]) to adjust Service Area
Restrictions. The UDM and the PCF may update the Service Area
Restrictions of a UE at any time. For the UE in CM-CONNECTED state the
AMF updates the UE and RAN immediately. For UE in CM-IDLE state the AMF
may page the UE immediately or store the updated service area
restriction and update the UE upon next signalling interaction with the
UE, as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\].

During registration, if the Service Area Restrictions of the UE is not
present in the AMF, the AMF fetches from the UDM the Service Area
Restrictions of the UE that may be further adjusted by the PCF. The
serving AMF shall enforce the Service Area Restrictions of a UE. A
limited allowed area given by a maximum allowed number of Tracking
Areas, may be dynamically assigned by the AMF adding any not yet visited
(by the UE) Tracking Areas to the limited allowed area until the maximum
allowed number of Tracking Areas is reached (i.e. the AMF adds new TAs
to the limited allowed area until the number of TAs is equal to the
maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas). The AMF deletes the list of
TAs that have been used up under the maximum allowed number of Tracking
Areas quota at every Initial Registration.

For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state the AMF shall indicate the Service Area
Restrictions of this UE to the RAN, using a Mobility Restriction List.

The UE shall store the received Service Area Restrictions and, if there
is previously stored Service Area Restrictions, replace them with the
newly received information. If the Service Area Restrictions include a
limited allowed area, the Service Area Restrictions are applicable for
the Tracking areas indicated in Service Area Restrictions. If the
Service Area Restrictions included an unlimited allowed area, the
received Service Area Restrictions are applicable for the registered
PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) that are available in the Registration
Area. The RAN uses the Service Area Restrictions for target cell
selection in Xn and N2 based handover.

Upon change of serving AMF due to mobility, the old AMF may provide the
new AMF with the Service Area Restrictions of the UE that may be further
adjusted by the PCF.

The network may perform paging for a UE to update Service Area
Restrictions with Generic UE Configuration Update procedure (see
clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

In the case of roaming, the Service Area Restrictions are transferred
from the UDM via the serving AMF to the serving PCF in the visited
network. The serving PCF in the visited network may further adjust the
Service Area Restrictions.

Support for Service Area Restrictions with NR satellite access is
described in clause 5.4.11.8.

#### 5.3.4.2 Mobility Pattern

The Mobility Pattern is a concept that may be used by the AMF to
characterise and optimise the UE mobility. The AMF determines and
updates Mobility Pattern of the UE based on subscription of the UE,
statistics of the UE mobility, network local policy, and the UE assisted
information, or any combination of them. The statistics of the UE
mobility can be historical or expected UE moving trajectory. If NWDAF is
deployed, the statistics of the UE mobility can also be analytics (i.e.
statistics or predictions) provided by the NWDAF (see TS 23.288 \[86\]).

The Mobility Pattern can be used by the AMF to optimize mobility support
provided to the UE, for example, Registration area allocation.

#### 5.3.4.3 Radio Resource Management functions

##### 5.3.4.3.1 General

To support radio resource management in NG-RAN the AMF provides the
parameter \'Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority\' (RFSP Index) to
NG-RAN across N2. The RFSP Index is mapped by the RAN to locally defined
configuration in order to apply specific RRM strategies, taking into
account any available information in RAN. The RFSP Index is UE specific
and applies to all the Radio Bearers. Examples of how this parameter may
be used by the RAN:

\- to derive UE specific cell reselection priorities to control idle
mode camping.

\- to decide on redirecting active mode UEs to different frequency
layers or RATs (e.g. see clause 5.3.4.3.2).

The HPLMN may set the RFSP Index taking into account the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs. The AMF receives the subscribed RFSP Index from the UDM (e.g.
during the Registration procedure). For non-roaming subscribers, the AMF
chooses the RFSP Index in use according to one of the following
procedures, depending on operator\'s configuration:

\- the RFSP Index in use is identical to the subscribed RFSP Index, or

\- the AMF chooses the RFSP Index in use based on the subscribed RFSP
Index, the locally configured operator\'s policies, the Allowed NSSAI
and the UE related context information available at the AMF, including
UE\'s usage setting, if received during Registration procedures (see
clause TS 23.502 \[3\]).

NOTE 1: One example of how the AMF can use the \"UE\'s usage setting,\"
is to select an RFSP value that enforces idle mode camping on E-UTRA for
a UE acting in a \"Voice centric\" way, in the case voice over NR is not
supported in the specific Registration Area and it contains NR cells.

The AMF may report to the PCF the subscribed RFSP Index received from
the UDM for further evaluation as described in clause 6.1.2.1 of
TS 23.503 \[45\]. When receiving the authorized RFSP Index from the PCF,
the AMF shall apply the authorized RFSP Index instead of the subscribed
RFSP Index for choosing the RFSP index in use (as described above). For
roaming subscribers, the AMF may choose the RFSP Index in use based on
the visited network policy, but can take input from the HPLMN into
account (e.g. an RFSP Index value pre-configured per HPLMN, or a single
RFSP Index value to be used for all roamers independent of the HPLMN).

The RFSP Index in use is also forwarded from source to target NG-RAN
node when Xn or N2 is used for intra-NG-RAN handover.

The AMF stores the subscribed RFSP Index value received and the RFSP
Index value in use. During the Registration procedure, the AMF may
update the RFSP Index value in use (e.g. the AMF may need to update the
RFSP Index value in use if the UE related context information in the AMF
has changed). When the RFSP Index value in use is changed, the AMF
immediately provides the updated RFSP Index value in use to NG-RAN node
by modifying an existing UE context or by establishing a new UE context
in RAN or by being configured to include the updated RFSP Index value in
use in the NGAP DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message if the user plane
establishment is not needed. During inter-AMF mobility procedures, the
source AMF forwards both RFSP Index values to the target AMF. The target
AMF may replace the received RFSP Index value in use with a new RFSP
Index value in use that is based on the operator\'s policies and the UE
related context information available at the target AMF.

In order to enable UE idle mode mobility control and priority-based
reselection mechanism considering availability of Network Slices at the
network and the Network Slices allowed for a UE, an RFSP is derived as
described in clause 5.3.4.3, considering also the Allowed NSSAI for the
UE.

A UE supporting NSAG (see clause 5.15.14) may be configured, for some of
the S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI, with NSAGs it can use as described
in TS 38.300 \[27\], TS 38.304 \[50\], TS 38.331 \[28\],
TS 38.321 \[143\], TS 24.501 \[47\] and as described in
clause 5.3.4.3.4.

##### 5.3.4.3.2 Preferred band(s) per data radio bearer(s)

The NG-RAN may prefer to use specific radio resources per data radio
bearer(s), e.g. depending on the Network Slices associated to the data
radio bearer used by the UE. The UE idle mode mobility control and
priority-based reselection mechanism operates as described in
clause 5.3.4.3.1, and when UP resources are activated e.g. for a
specific S-NSSAI the NG-RAN can use local policies to decide on what
specific radio resources to use for the associated data radio bearer(s).
A UE may be served by a set of data radio bearers which may be served by
cells in different bands, selected based on RRM policies.

##### 5.3.4.3.3 Redirection to dedicated frequency band(s) for an S-NSSAI

If a Network Slice, S-NSSAI, is configured to be available only in TAs
covering specific dedicated frequency band(s), then there may be a need
to redirect the UE to the dedicated frequency band(s) when such S-NSSAI
is requested. If the Requested NSSAI contains S-NSSAI(s) that are not
available in the UE\'s current TA, see clause 5.15.8, the AMF itself or
by interacting with the NSSF as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 may
determine a Target NSSAI to be used by the NG-RAN, in addition to the
information the AMF receives, such as the Allowed NSSAI and the RFSP for
the Allowed NSSAI, to attempt to redirect the UE to a cell and TA in
another frequency band and TA that supports the S-NSSAIs in the Target
NSSAI. The Target NSSAI includes at least one S-NSSAI from the Requested
NSSAI not available in the current TA, but available in another TA in
different frequency band possibly overlapping with the current TA, and
optionally additional S-NSSAIs from the Requested NSSAI that are
configured to be available within the same TAs as the S-NSSAIs not
available in the current TA. If the serving PLMN supports the
subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network
slices (see clause 5.15.12), and if the UE has NSSRG as part of the
subscription information received from the HPLMN, the Target NSSAI
includes only S-NSSAIs sharing at least one NSSRG.

The Target NSSAI may be excluding some of the Allowed NSSAIs and include
some of the rejected S-NSSAIs due to lack of support in the TA where the
UE is located based on network policies that are in line with customer
and operator agreements. The Target NSSAI shall only include S-NSSAIs
that can be provided in an Allowed NSSAI for the UE. The Target NSSAI
may include e.g.:

\- all or a subset of the Rejected S-NSSAIs for RA when none of the
S-NSSAIs in the Requested S-NSSAI were available in the TA where the UE
is;

\- all the S-NSSAIs of the Allowed NSSAI and all or a subset of the
Rejected S-NSSAIs for the RA;

\- a subset of the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI and all or a subset of
the Rejected S-NSSAIs for the RA if the operator policy is to prefer
this Target S-NSSAI to the Allowed NSSAI.

The AMF should retrieve an RFSP Index suitable for the Target NSSAI and
includes the RFSP Index in the information sent to the NG-RAN. The AMF
retrieves the RFSP Index from the PCF or, in case PCF is not deployed
the AMF determines the RFSP Index according to local configuration. The
RFSP index associated to the Target NSSAI is considered if the RAN
succeeds to redirect the UE to a new TA outside the RA, otherwise the
RFSP index of the Allowed NSSAI is considered.

If the Requested NSSAI contains S-NSSAI(s) which map to S-NSSAI(s) of
the HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization that are not available in the UE\'s current TA, the AMF
shall proceed with the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization procedure as described in clause 4.2.9 of TS 23.502 \[3\].
If the AMF determines a new Allowed NSSAI at the end of Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization steps and some S-NSSAI
is not available in the UE\'s current TA, a Target NSSAI and
corresponding RFSP index may be determined and provided to NG-RAN during
UE Configuration Update procedure as described in clause 4.2.4.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The NG-RAN shall attempt to find cells of TAs that can support all the
S-NSSAIs in the Target S-NSSAIs, and if no such cell of a TA is
available the RAN can attempt to select cells of TAs that best match the
Target S-NSSAI. The NG-RAN shall attempt to ensure continuity of the PDU
Sessions with activated User Plane associated with the S-NSSAIs in the
Allowed NSSAI which are in the Target NSSAI. Also, the NG-RAN should
attempt to ensure continuity of service for the S-NSSAIs of the Allowed
NSSAI also available in the Target NSSAI, before prioritizing cells that
are not supporting one or more of the S-NSSAI of the Allowed NSSAI also
available in the Target NSSAI.

The NG-RAN attempts to determine target cell(s) supporting the Target
NSSAI considering the UE Radio Capabilities (i.e. the AMF (if available
in the UE context) shall provide the NG-RAN with the current UE Radio
Capability Information or the RACS UE Radio Capability ID when a Target
NSSAI is provided, if the NG-RAN had not yet received any of them, or,
if the AMF cannot provide any of these, the UE Radio Capability
Information may be retrieved by the NG-RAN from the UE).

Once the target cells are determined, the NG-RAN initiates RRC
redirection procedure towards the target cells, or the NG-RAN initiates
handover for the UE with active PDU Sessions associated with the
S-NSSAIs which are in the Target NSSAI, if possible.

After a successful redirection or handover of the UE to a new TA outside
the current RA, the UE shall perform a Mobility Registration Update
procedure and the S-NSSAIs the new TA supports can be allowed if the UE
requests them. In order to ensure that the UE is redirected to a TA
outside the current RA, thus triggering a Mobility Registration Update
procedure enabling the UE to request the S-NSSAI(s) that were rejected
for the RA, the AMF shall set the RA so that the RA does not include TAs
supporting the S-NSSAIs rejected for the RA included in the Target NSSAI
when the AMF provides a Target NSSAI to the RAN.

##### 5.3.4.3.4 Network Slice based cell reselection and Random Access

When one or more S-NSSAI(s) are associated with NSAG(s), the UE may
perform Network Slice based cell reselection and Random Access as
described in TS 38.300 \[27\], TS 38.304 \[50\], TS 38.331 \[28\],
TS 38.321 \[143\] and TS 24.501 \[47\].

When providing NSAG Information to the UE, the AMF shall also provide
the NSAG priority information for the NSAGs provided in the NSAG
Information. The AMF determines the NSAG priority information based on
configured local policy of the serving PLMN or SNPN.

NOTE 1: How the AMF assigns the NSAG priority information per UE is not
specified but AMF can take into account information like e.g. UE MM
capabilities, Subscribed S-NSSAIs and HPLMN.

NOTE 2: The AMF can assign same priority value for NSAGs provided in the
NSAG Information.

If the UE has received NSAG Information from the AMF, the UE shall use
the NSAG Information provided by the AMF for cell reselection and Random
Access as described below. If the UE has not received any NSAG
Information from the AMF, the UE shall not use Network Slice based cell
reselection and Random Access at all.

The UE NAS provides to the UE AS the NSAG Information as received from
the AMF and the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI as input to cell
reselection, except when the UE intends to register with a new set of
S-NSSAIs with a Requested NSSAI different from the current Allowed
NSSAI, in which case the UE NAS provides to the UE AS layer the NSAG
Information as received from the AMF and the S-NSSAIs in the Requested
NSSAI, and this may trigger a cell reselection, before sending the
Registration Request including the new Requested NSSAI.

For Network Slice based Random Access, different Random Access resources
may be assigned to different NSAG(s). The UE determines Random Access
configuration among NSAGs that are published in SIB for Random Access
and that are associated to the S-NSSAIs triggering the access. If the
signalling transaction triggering the access attempt is related to more
than one network slice, and the S-NSSAIs of these network slices are
associated with more than one NSAG for Random Access, the NSAG with the
highest priority is selected.

NOTE 3: How the UE NAS provides the NSAGs priorities to UE AS is based
internal UE interface, and not specified.

#### 5.3.4.4 UE mobility event notification

5G System supports the functionality of tracking and reporting UE
mobility events.

The AMF provides the UE mobility related event reporting to NF that has
been authorized to subscribe to the UE mobility event reporting service.
Any NF service consumer such as SMF, NEF or NWDAF that wants to be
reported on the UE location is able to subscribe to the UE mobility
event notification service to the AMF with the following parameters:

\- Event reporting type that specifies what to be reported on UE
mobility (e.g. UE location, UE mobility on Area of Interest).

\- Event filters indicating the:

\- Area Of Interest that specifies a location area within 3GPP system.
The Area Of Interest is represented by a list of Tracking Areas, list of
cells or list of (R)AN node identifiers. In the case of LADN, the event
consumer (e.g. SMF) provides the LADN DNN to refer the LADN service area
as the Area Of Interest. In the case of PRA, the event consumer (e.g.
SMF or PCF) may provide an identifier for Area Of Interest to refer
predefined area as the Area Of Interest.

\- S-NSSAI and optionally the NSI ID(s).

\- Event Reporting Information: event reporting mode, number of reports,
maximum duration of reporting, event reporting condition (e.g. when the
target UE moved into a specified Area Of Interest, immediate reporting
flag).

\- Notification Endpoint of NF service consumer to be notified.

\- The target of event reporting that indicates a specific UE, a group
of UE(s) or any UE (i.e. all UEs). Further details on the information
provided by the NF service consumer are provided in clause 4.15 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

If an NF service consumer subscribes to the UE mobility event
notification service provided by AMF for reporting of UE presence in
Area Of Interest, the AMF tracks UE\'s location considering UE\'s CM
state and using NG-RAN procedures (if RRC Inactive state applies to
NG-RAN) in order to determine the UE presence in the Area Of Interest,
as described in clause 4.15.4.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. Upon detecting the
change of the UE presence in the Area Of Interest, the AMF notifies the
UE presence in the Area Of Interest and the new UE location to the
subscribed NF consumer.

When the AMF is changed, the subscription of mobility event is
transferred from the old AMF. The new AMF may decide not to notify the
SMF with the current status related to the subscription of mobility
event if the new AMF determines that, based on MM Context of the UE, the
event is reported by the old AMF.

In the network deployment where a UE may leave or enter the Area Of
Interest without any notification to the 5GC in CM-CONNECTED state (i.e.
in the case that RRC Inactive state applies to the NG-RAN), the AMF may
initiate the NG-RAN location reporting as described in clause 5.4.7 or
N2 Notification as described in clause 4.8.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\] to track
the UE presence in the Area Of Interest.

The AMF may provide UE mobility event reporting to PCF, using Policy
Control Report Triggers defined in TS 23.503 \[45\].

### 5.3.5 Triggers for network analytics

Triggers for the AMF to request for or subscribe to the analytics
information from the NWDAF are internal logic in the AMF and may include
for example:

\- UE access and mobility related event subscription by other NFs (e.g.
SMF, NEF);

\- locally detected events;

\- analytics information received.

The trigger conditions may depend on operator and implementation policy
in the AMF. When a trigger condition happens, the AMF may decide if any
analytics information is needed and if so, request for or subscription
to the analytics information from the NWDAF.

The AMF may, upon detection of certain local events, e.g. frequent
mobility re-registration of one or more UEs, subscribe to mobility
related abnormal behaviour analytics of the UE(s) as described in
TS 23.288 \[86\] in order to trace UE mobility trend and take
appropriate actions.

## 5.4 3GPP access specific aspects

### 5.4.1 UE reachability in CM-IDLE

#### 5.4.1.1 General

Reachability management is responsible for detecting whether the UE is
reachable and providing UE location (i.e. access node) for the network
to reach the UE. This is done by paging UE and UE location tracking. The
UE location tracking includes both UE registration area tracking (i.e.
UE registration area update) and UE reachability tracking ((i.e. UE
periodic registration area update)). Such functionalities can be either
located at 5GC (in the case of CM-IDLE state) or NG-RAN (in the case of
CM-CONNECTED state).

The UE and the AMF negotiate UE reachability characteristics for CM-IDLE
state during Registration procedures.

Two UE reachability categories are negotiated between UE and AMF for
CM-IDLE state:

1\. UE reachability allowing Mobile Terminated data while the UE is
CM-IDLE state.

\- The UE location is known by the network on a Tracking Area List
granularity

\- Paging procedures apply to this category.

\- Mobile originating and mobile terminated data apply in this category
for both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE state.

2\. Mobile Initiated Connection Only (MICO) mode:

\- Mobile originated data applies in this category for both CM-CONNECTED
and CM-IDLE state.

\- Mobile terminated data is only supported when the UE is in
CM-CONNECTED state.

Whenever a UE in RM-REGISTERED state enters CM-IDLE state, it starts a
periodic registration timer according to the periodic registration timer
value received from the AMF during a Registration procedure.

The AMF allocates a periodic registration timer value to the UE based on
local policies, subscription information and information provided by the
UE. After the expiry of the periodic registration timer, the UE shall
perform a periodic registration. If the UE moves out of network coverage
when its periodic registration timer expires, the UE shall perform a
Registration procedure when it next returns to the coverage.

The AMF runs a Mobile Reachable timer for the UE. The timer is started
with a value longer than the UE\'s periodic registration timer whenever
the CM state for the UE in RM-REGISTERED state changes to CM-IDLE. If
the AMF receives an elapsed time from RAN when RAN initiate UE context
release indicating UE unreachable, the AMF should deduce a Mobile
Reachable timer value based on the elapsed time received from RAN and
the normal Mobile Reachable timer value. The AMF stops the Mobile
Reachable timer, if the UE CM state in the AMF moves to CM-CONNECTED
state. If the Mobile Reachable timer expires, the AMF determines that
the UE is not reachable.

However, the AMF does not know for how long the UE remains not
reachable, thus the AMF shall not immediately de-register the UE.
Instead, after the expiry of the Mobile Reachable timer, the AMF should
clear the PPF and shall start an Implicit De-registration timer, with a
relatively large value. The AMF shall stop the Implicit De-registration
timer and set the PPF if the AMF moves the UE CM state in the AMF to
CM-CONNECTED state.

NOTE: If the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE, then AMF considers the
UE always unreachable if the UE is in MICO mode (refer to
clause 5.4.1.3).

If the PPF is not set, the AMF does not page the UE and shall reject any
request for delivering DL signalling or data to this UE.

If the Implicit De-registration timer expires before the UE contacts the
network, the AMF implicitly de-register the UE.

As part of deregistration for a particular access (3GPP or non-3GPP),
the AMF shall request the UE\'s related SMF to release the PDU Sessions
established on that access.

#### 5.4.1.2 UE reachability allowing mobile terminated data while the UE is CM-IDLE

The AMF considers a UE in RM-REGISTERED state to be reachable by CN
paging if the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE state unless the UE
applies MICO mode.

#### 5.4.1.3 Mobile Initiated Connection Only (MICO) mode

A UE may indicate preference for MICO mode during Initial Registration
or Mobility Registration Update procedure. The AMF, based on local
configuration, Expected UE Behaviour and/or Network Configuration
parameters if available from the UDM, UE indicated preferences, UE
subscription information and network policies, or any combination of
them, determines whether MICO mode is allowed for the UE and indicates
it to the UE during Registration procedure. If NWDAF is deployed, the
AMF may also use analytics on UE mobility and/or UE communication
generated by NWDAF (see TS 23.288 \[86\]) to decide MICO mode
parameters. If the UE does not indicate preference for MICO mode during
Registration procedure, the AMF shall not activate MICO mode for this
UE.

The UE and the AMF re- negotiate the MICO mode at every subsequent
Registration procedure. When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED, the AMF may
deactivate MICO mode by triggering Mobility Registration Update
procedure through UE Configuration Update procedure as described in
clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AMF assigns a registration area to the UE during the Registration
procedure. When the AMF indicates MICO mode to a UE, the registration
area is not constrained by paging area size. If the AMF serving area is
the whole PLMN, based on local policy, and subscription information, may
decide to provide an \"all PLMN\" registration area to the UE. In that
case, re-registration to the same PLMN due to mobility does not apply.

If Mobility Restrictions are applied to a UE in MICO mode, the AMF needs
to allocate an Allowed Area/Non-Allowed Area to the UE as specified in
clause 5.3.4.1.

When the AMF indicates MICO mode to a UE, the AMF considers the UE
always unreachable while the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE. The AMF
rejects any request for downlink data delivery for UE in MICO mode and
whose UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE with an appropriate cause. For
MT-SMS over NAS, the AMF notifies the SMSF that UE is not reachable,
then the procedure of the unsuccessful Mobile terminating SMS delivery
described in clause 4.13.3.9 of TS 23.502 \[3\] is performed. The AMF
also defers location services, etc. The UE in MICO mode is only
reachable for mobile terminated data or signalling when the UE is in
CM-CONNECTED.

A UE in MICO mode need not listen to paging while in CM-IDLE. A UE in
MICO mode may stop any access stratum procedures in CM-IDLE, until the
UE initiates transition from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED due to one of the
following triggers:

\- A change in the UE (e.g. change in configuration) requires an update
of its registration with the network.

\- Periodic registration timer expires.

\- MO data pending.

\- MO signalling pending (e.g. SM procedure initiated).

If a registration area that is not the \"all PLMN\" registration area is
allocated to a UE in MICO mode, then the UE determines if it is within
the registration area or not when it has MO data or MO signalling, and
the UE performs Mobility Registration Update before the UE initiates the
MO data or MO signalling if it is not within the registration area.

A UE initiating emergency service shall not indicate MICO preference
during Registration procedure. When the MICO mode is already activated
in the UE, the UE and AMF shall locally disable MICO mode after PDU
Session Establishment procedure for Emergency Services is completed
successfully. The UE and the AMF shall not enable MICO mode until the
AMF accepts the use of MICO mode in the next registration procedure. To
enable an emergency call back, the UE should wait for a UE
implementation-specific duration of time before requesting the use of
MICO mode after the release of the emergency PDU session.

In order to enable power saving for MT reachability e.g. for Cellular
IoT, enhancements to MICO mode are specified in clause 5.31.7:

\- MICO mode with Extended Connected Time.

\- MICO mode with Active Time.

\- MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control.

### 5.4.2 UE reachability in CM-CONNECTED

For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state:

\- the AMF knows the UE location on a serving (R)AN node granularity.

\- the NG-RAN notifies the AMF when UE becomes unreachable from RAN
point of view.

UE RAN reachability management is used by RAN for UEs in RRC Inactive
state, see TS 38.300 \[27\]. The location of a UE in RRC Inactive state
is known by the RAN on a RAN Notification area granularity. A UE in RRC
Inactive state is paged in cells of the RAN Notification area that is
assigned to the UEs. The RAN Notification area can be a subset of cells
configured in UE\'s Registration Area or all cells configured in the
UE\'s Registration Area. UE in RRC Inactive state performs RAN
Notification Area Update when entering a cell that is not part of the
RAN Notification area that is assigned to the UE.

At transition into RRC Inactive state RAN configures the UE with a
periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer value and the timer is
restarted in the UE with this initial timer value. After the expiry of
the periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer in the UE, the UE in RRC
Inactive state performs periodic RAN Notification Area Update, as
specified in TS 38.300 \[27\].

To aid the UE reachability management in the AMF, RAN uses a guard timer
with a value longer than the RAN Notification Area Update timer value
provided to the UE. Upon the expiry of the periodic RAN Notification
Area Update guard timer in RAN, the RAN shall initiate the AN Release
procedure as specified in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The RAN may provide the
elapsed time since RAN\'s last contact with the UE to AMF.

### 5.4.3 Paging strategy handling

#### 5.4.3.1 General

Based on operator configuration, the 5GS supports the AMF and NG-RAN to
apply different paging strategies for different types of traffic.

In the case of UE in CM-IDLE state, the AMF performs paging and
determines the paging strategy based on e.g. local configuration, what
NF triggered the paging and information available in the request that
triggered the paging. If NWDAF is deployed, the AMF may also use
analytics (i.e. statistics or predictions) on the UE\'s mobility as
provided by NWDAF (see TS 23.288 \[86\]).

In the case of UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN
performs paging and determines the paging strategy based on e.g. local
configuration, and information received from AMF as described in
clause 5.4.6.3 and SMF as described in clause 5.4.3.2.

In the case of Network Triggered Service Request from SMF, the SMF
determines the 5QI and ARP based on the downlink packet (if the SMF
performs buffering) or the Downlink Data Report received from UPF (if
the UPF performs buffering). The SMF includes the 5QI and ARP
corresponding to the QoS Flow of the received downlink PDU in the
request sent to the AMF. If the UE is in CM IDLE, the AMF uses e.g. the
5QI and ARP to derive different paging strategies as described in
clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE: The 5QI is used by AMF to determine suitable paging strategies.

#### 5.4.3.2 Paging Policy Differentiation

Paging policy differentiation is an optional feature that allows the
AMF, based on operator configuration, to apply different paging
strategies for different traffic or service types provided within the
same PDU Session. In this Release of the specification this feature
applies only to PDU Session of IP type.

When the 5GS supports the Paging Policy Differentiation (PPD) feature,
the DSCP value (TOS in IPv4 / TC in IPv6) is set by the application to
indicate to the 5GS which Paging Policy should be applied for a certain
IP packet. For example, as defined in TS 23.228 \[15\], the P-CSCF may
support Paging Policy Differentiation by marking packet(s) to be sent
towards the UE that relate to a specific IMS services (e.g.
conversational voice as defined in IMS multimedia telephony service).

NOTE 1: This PPD feature may be used to determine the Paging Cause
Indication for Voice Service, as described in clause 5.38.3.

It shall be possible for the operator to configure the SMF in such a way
that the Paging Policy Differentiation feature only applies to certain
HPLMNs, DNNs and 5QIs. In the case of HR roaming, this configuration is
done in the SMF in the VPLMN.

NOTE 2: Support of Paging Policy Differentiation in the case of HR
roaming requires inter operator agreements including on the DSCP value
associated with this feature.

In the case of Network Triggered Service Request and UPF buffering
downlink packets, the UPF shall include the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC
(IPv6) value from the IP header of the downlink packet and an indication
of the corresponding QoS Flow in the Downlink Data Report sent to the
SMF. When PPD applies, the SMF determines the Paging Policy Indicator
(PPI) based on the DSCP received from the UPF.

In the case of Network Triggered Service Request and SMF buffering
downlink packets, when PPD applies, the SMF determines the PPI based on
the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value from the IP header of the
received downlink packet and identifies the corresponding QoS Flow from
the QFI of the received downlink packet.

The SMF includes the PPI, the ARP and the 5QI of the corresponding QoS
Flow in the N11 message sent to the AMF. If the UE is in CM IDLE, the
AMF uses this information to derive a paging strategy, and sends paging
messages to NG-RAN over N2.

NOTE 3: Network configuration needs to ensure that the information used
as a trigger for Paging Policy Indication is not changed within the 5GS.

NOTE 4: Network configuration needs to ensure that the specific DSCP in
TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value, used as a trigger for Paging Policy
Indication, is managed correctly in order to avoid the accidental use of
certain paging policies.

For a UE in RRC Inactive state the NG-RAN may enforce specific paging
policies in the case of NG-RAN paging, based on 5QI, ARP and PPI
associated with an incoming DL PDU. To enable this, the SMF instructs
the UPF to detect the DSCP in the TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value in the IP
header of the DL PDU (by using a DL PDR with the DSCP for this traffic)
and to transfer the corresponding PPI in the CN tunnel header (by using
a QER with the PPI value). The NG-RAN can then utilize the PPI received
in the CN tunnel header of an incoming DL PDU in order to apply the
corresponding paging policy for the case the UE needs to be paged when
in RRC Inactive state. In the case of Home-Routed roaming, the V-SMF is
responsible of controlling UPF setting of the PPI. In the case of PDU
Session with I-SMF, the I-SMF is responsible of controlling UPF setting
of the PPI.

#### 5.4.3.3 Paging Priority

Paging Priority is a feature that allows the AMF to include an
indication in the Paging Message sent to NG-RAN that the UE be paged
with priority. The decision by the AMF whether to include Paging
Priority in the Paging Message is based on the ARP value in the message
received from the SMF for an IP packet waiting to be delivered in the
UPF. If the ARP value is associated with select priority services (e.g.
MPS, MCS), the AMF includes Paging Priority in the Paging Message. When
the NG-RAN receives a Paging Message with Paging Priority, it handles
the page with priority.

The AMF while waiting for the UE to respond to a page sent without
priority receives another message from the SMF with an ARP associated
with select priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), the AMF sends another
Paging message to the (R)AN including the Paging Priority. For
subsequent messages, the AMF may determine whether to send the Paging
message with higher Paging Priority based on local policy.

For a UE in RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN determines Paging Priority
based on the ARP associated with the QoS Flow as provisioned by the
operator policy, and the Core Network Assisted RAN paging information
from AMF as described in clause 5.4.6.3.

### 5.4.4 UE Radio Capability handling

#### 5.4.4.1 UE radio capability information storage in the AMF

This clause applies when no radio capability signalling optimisation is
used between a UE and the network.

The UE Radio Capability information is defined in TS 38.300 \[27\] and
contains information on RATs that the UE supports (e.g. power class,
frequency bands, etc). Consequently, this information can be
sufficiently large that it is undesirable to send it across the radio
interface at every transition of UE CM state in the AMF from CM‑IDLE to
CM‑CONNECTED. To avoid this radio overhead, the AMF shall store the UE
Radio Capability information during CM‑IDLE state for the UE and
RM-REGISTERED state for the UE and the AMF shall if it is available,
send its most up to date UE Radio Capability information to the RAN in
the N2 REQUEST message, i.e. INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST or UE RADIO
CAPABILITY CHECK REQUEST.

NOTE 1: Due to issues with the handling of dynamic UMTS security
parameters, the UTRA UE Radio Capability information is excluded from
the information that is uploaded and stored in the AMF (see
TS 38.300 \[27\]).

The AMF deletes the UE radio capability when the UE RM state in the AMF
transitions to RM-DEREGISTERED. When the AMF receives Registration
Request with the Registration type set to Initial Registration or when
it receives the first Registration Request after E-UTRA/EPC Attach with
Registration type set to Mobility Registration Update, the AMF deletes
the UE radio capability.

The UE Radio Capability is maintained in the core network, even during
AMF reselection.

NOTE 2: The UE Radio Capability is not transferred to EPC during the
inter-system mobility.

If the UE\'s NG-RAN or E‑UTRAN UE Radio Capability information changes
while in CM-IDLE state, the UE shall perform the Registration procedure
with the Registration type set to Mobility Registration Update and it
also includes \"UE Radio Capability Update\". (For specific requirements
for a UE operating in dual-registration mode see clause 5.17.2.1). When
the AMF receives Mobility Registration Update Request with \"UE Radio
Capability Update\" requested by the UE, it shall delete any UE Radio
Capability information that it has stored for the UE. If the UE\'s
NG-RAN UE Radio Capability information changes when the UE is in CM-IDLE
with Suspend, NAS shall trigger AS to establish a new RRC connection and
not resume the existing one in order to perform the Registration
procedure with the Registration type set to Mobility Registration Update
including \"UE Radio Capability Update\". As a result of this, the
access stratum in the UE will discard the AS information and establish a
new RRC connection as defined in TS 36.331 \[51\].

If the trigger to change the UE\'s NG-RAN or E‑UTRAN UE Radio Capability
information happens when the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the UE shall
first enter CM-IDLE state and then perform the Registration procedure
with the Registration type set to Mobility Registration Update and it
also includes \"UE Radio Capability Update\".

The RAN stores the UE Radio Capability information, received in the N2
message or obtained from the UE, for the duration of the UE staying in
RRC connected or RRC Inactive state. Before any 5G SRVCC handover
attempt from NG-RAN to UTRAN, the RAN retrieves the UE\'s UTRA UE Radio
Capabilities from the UE. (For specific requirements for a UE operating
in dual-registration mode see clause 5.17.2.1).

If the AMF sends N2 REQUEST (i.e. INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST or UE
RADIO CAPABILITY CHECK REQUEST) message to NG-RAN without UE Radio
Capability information in that message and there is no UE Radio
Capability information available in RAN, this triggers the RAN to
request the UE Radio Capability from the UE and to upload it to the AMF
in the N2 UE RADIO CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message.

If a UE supports both NB-IoT and other RATs the UE handles the UE Radio
capability information as follows:

\- When the UE is camping on NB-IoT the UE provides only NB-IoT UE radio
capabilities to the network.

\- When the UE is not camping on NB-IoT, the UE provides UE radio
capabilities for the RAT but not NB-IoT UE radio capabilities to the
network.

In order to handle the distinct UE radio capabilities, the AMF stores a
separate NB-IoT specific UE Radio Capability information when the UE
provides the UE Radio Capability information while camping on NB-IoT.

When the UE is camping on NB-IoT, the AMF sends, if available, the
NB-IoT RAT specific UE Radio Capability information to the E-UTRAN.

When the UE is not camping on NB-IoT, the AMF sends, if available, UE
radio capabilities for the RAT but not NB-IoT radio capabilities.

#### 5.4.4.1a UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS)

With the increase of the size of UE radio capabilities driven e.g. by
additional frequency bands and combinations thereof for E-UTRA and NR,
an efficient approach to signal UE Radio Capability Information over the
radio interface and other network interfaces is defined with RACS.

In this Release of the specification, RACS does not apply to NB-IOT.

RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent a set of UE radio
capabilities. This identifier is called UE Radio Capability ID. A UE
Radio Capability ID can be either UE manufacturer-assigned or
PLMN-assigned, as specified in clause 5.9.10. The UE Radio Capability ID
is an alternative to the signalling of the UE Radio Capability
information over the radio interface, within NG-RAN, from NG-RAN to
E-UTRAN, from AMF to NG-RAN and between CN nodes supporting RACS.

PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is assigned to the UE using the UE
Configuration Update Command, or Registration Accept as defined in
TS 23.502 \[3\]. The UCMF shall be configured with a Version ID for
PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs, defined in clause 5.9.10.

The UCMF (UE radio Capability Management Function) stores all UE Radio
Capability ID mappings in a PLMN and is responsible for assigning every
PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in this PLMN, see clause 6.2.21.
The UCMF stores the UE Radio Capability IDs alongside the UE Radio
Capability information and the UE Radio Capability for Paging they map
to. Each UE Radio Capability ID stored in the UCMF can be associated to
one or both UE radio capabilities formats specified in TS 36.331 \[51\]
and TS 38.331 \[28\]. The two UE radio capabilities formats shall be
identifiable by the AMF and UCMF and the AMF shall store the
TS 38.331 \[28\] format only.

An NG-RAN which supports RACS can be configured to operate with one of
two modes of operation when providing the UE radio capabilities to the
AMF when the NG-RAN executes a UE Radio Capability Enquiry procedure
(see TS 38.331 \[28\]) to retrieve UE radio capabilities from the UE:

\- Mode of operation A): The NG-RAN provides to the AMF both formats
(i.e. the TS 38.331 \[28\] format and TS 36.331 \[51\] format). The
NG-RAN derives one of the UE Radio Capability formats using local
transcoding of the other format it receives from the UE and extracts the
E-UTRAN UE Radio Capability for Paging and NR UE Radio Capability for
Paging from the UE Radio capabilities.

\- Mode of operation B): The NG-RAN provides to the AMF the
TS 38.331 \[28\] format only.

In a PLMN supporting RACS only in 5GS, Mode of Operation B shall be
configured.

If the PLMN supports RACS in both EPS and 5GS:

\- If RAN nodes in the EPS and 5GS are configured in Mode of operation
B, then the UCMF shall be capable to transcode between TS 36.331 \[51\]
and TS 38.331 \[28\] formats and the UCMF shall be able to generate the
RAT-specific UE Radio Capability for Paging information from the UE
Radio Capability.

\- If the NG-RAN is configured to operate according to Mode A, then also
the E-UTRAN shall be configured to operate according to mode A and the
UMCF is not required to transcode between TS 36.331 \[51\] and
TS 38.331 \[28\] formats and the AMF shall provide the UE Radio
Capability for Paging information.

When the NG-RAN updates the AMF with new UE radio capabilities
information, the AMF provides the information obtained from the NG-RAN
to the UCMF even if the AMF already has a UE Radio Capability ID for
that UE. The UCMF then returns a value of UE Radio Capability ID. If the
value is different from the one stored in the AMF, the AMF updates the
UE Radio Capability ID it stores and provides this new value to the
NG-RAN (if applicable) and to the UE.

In order to be able to interpret the UE Radio Capability ID a Network
Function or node may store a local copy of the mapping between the UE
Radio Capability ID and its corresponding UE Radio Capability
information i.e. a dictionary entry. When no mapping is available
between a UE Radio Capability ID and the corresponding UE Radio
Capability information in a Network Function or node, this Network
Function or node shall be able to retrieve this mapping and store it.

\- An AMF which supports RACS shall store such UE Radio Capability ID
mapping at least for all the UEs that it serves that have a UE Radio
Capability ID assigned.

\- The NG-RAN performs local caching of the UE Radio Capability
information for the UE Radio Capability IDs for the UEs it is serving,
and potentially for other UE Radio Capability IDs according to suitable
local policies.

\- When the NG-RAN needs to retrieve the mapping of a UE Radio
Capability ID to the corresponding UE Radio Capability information, it
queries the AMF using N2 signalling defined in TS 38.413 \[34\].

\- When the AMF needs to obtain a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
for a UE from the UCMF, it provides the UE Radio Capability information
it has for the current radio configuration of the UE and the IMEI/TAC
for the UE and the UCMF returns a UE Radio Capability ID. The AMF shall
provide to the UCMF the UE Radio Capability information (and at least in
Mode A, the UE Radio Capability for Paging) obtained from the NG-RAN in
one or both the TS 36.331 \[51\] and TS 38.331 \[28\] formats depending
on how the RAN is configured. The UCMF stores the association of this
IMEI/TAC with this UE Radio Capability ID and the UE Radio Capability
information and the UE Radio Capability for Paging in all the formats it
receives. The UE Radio Capability information formats the AMF provides
shall be identifiable at the UCMF.

\- When the AMF needs to obtain the UE Radio Capability information and
the UE Radio Capability for Paging associated to a UE Radio Capability
ID it provides the UE Radio Capability ID to the UCMF with an indication
that it is requesting the TS 38.331 \[28\] format and the UCMF returns a
mapping of the UE Radio Capability ID to the corresponding UE Radio
Capability information in TS 38.331 \[28\] format to the AMF.

\- UEs, AMFs and RAN nodes which support RACS learn the current value of
the Version ID when a new PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is
received from the UCMF and the Version ID it contains is different from
the ones in their PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability ID cache. For a
PLMN, PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs related to old values (i.e.
not current value) of the Version ID can be removed from cache but, if
so, prior to removing any cached PLMN-assigned UE radio Capability IDs
with the current value of the Version ID. The AMF, RAN and UE may
continue to use the stored PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability IDs with
old values of the Version ID, until these are purged from cache. If an
out of date PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability ID is removed form an AMF
cache, the AMF shall proceed to assign a new PLMN assigned UE Radio
Capability ID to all the UEs for which the UE context includes the
removed PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID using a UE Configuration
Update procedure, or when these UEs perform a Registration. If the AMF
attempts to resolve a PLMN assigned UE Radio capability ID with an old
Version ID, the UCMF shall return an error code indicating that the
Version ID in the UE radio capability ID is no longer current and
proceed to assign a new UE Radio Capability ID to the UE.

If at any time the AMF has neither a valid UE Radio Capability ID nor
any stored UE radio capabilities for the UE, the AMF may trigger the RAN
to provide the UE Radio Capability information and subsequently request
the UCMF to allocate a UE Radio Capability ID.

\- The RAN, in order to support MOCN network sharing scenarios, shall be
capable to cache PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability IDs per PLMN ID.

A network may utilise the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, without
involving the UE, e.g. for use with legacy UEs.

Mutual detection of the support of the RACS feature happens between
directly connected NG-RAN nodes and between NG-RAN and AMF using
protocol means as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\] and TS 38.423 \[99\]. To
allow for a mix of RACS-supporting and non-RACS-supporting RAN nodes
over the Xn interfaces, the UE Radio Capability ID should be included in
the Path Switch signalling during Xn based handover and Handover Request
during N2 based handover between AMF and NG-RAN. In addition,
RACS-supporting RAN nodes can be discovered across inter-CN node
boundaries by using the mechanism defined in TS 38.413 \[34\] that
allows the source NG-RAN node to retrieve information on the level of
support for a certain feature at the target NG-RAN side by means of
information provided within the Source to Target and Target to Source
transparent handover containers during handover procedure. The support
of RACS by peer AMFs or MMEs is based on configuration in a PLMN or
across PLMNs.

A UE that supports WB-E-UTRA and/or NR indicates its support for RACS to
AMF using UE MM Core Network Capability as defined in clause 5.4.4a.

A UE that supports RACS and stores an applicable UE Radio Capability ID
for the current UE Radio Configuration in the PLMN, shall signal the UE
Radio Capability ID in the Initial, and Mobility Registration procedure
as defined in TS 23.502 \[3\] and based on triggers defined in
TS 24.501 \[47\]. If both PLMN-assigned for the current PLMN and UE
manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs are stored in the UE and
applicable in the PLMN, the UE shall signal the PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability ID in the Registration Request message.

When a PLMN decides to switch to request a particular type of UE to use
UE manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s):

\- The UCMF sends a Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement_Notify message to the
AMF including either a list of UE Radio Capability IDs (if the UE was
previously using any PLMN-assigned IDs) or the IMEI/TAC values
corresponding to UE types that are requested to use UE
manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID. These values are stored in
a \"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\" in the AMF.

\- The AMF uses the Registration Accept message or the UE Configuration
Update command message to request the UE to delete all the PLMN-assigned
UE Radio Capability ID(s) for this PLMN if the UE is, respectively,
registering or is registered with PLMN-assigned ID or IMEI/TAC values
matching one value in the \"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested
list\".

NOTE 1: It is expected that in a given PLMN the UCMF and AMFs will be
configured to either use a UE manufacturer-assigned operation requested
list based on a list of PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs or a list
of IMEI/TACs, but not both.

NOTE 2: The strategy for triggering of the deletion of PLMN-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID(s) in the UE by the AMF is implementation-specific
(e.g. can be used only towards UEs in CM_Connected state).

\- a UE that receives indication to delete all the PLMN-assigned UE
Radio Capability IDs in the Registration Accept message, or UE
Configuration Update command message, shall delete any PLMN-assigned UE
Radio Capability IDs for this PLMN. The UE proceeds to register with a
UE manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID that is applicable to
the current UE Radio configuration.

\- When the \"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\"
contains PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs, the UCMF shall avoid
re-assigning PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs that were added to
the \"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\" in the AMFs to
any UE.

\- The AMF stores a PLMN-assigned ID in the \"UE Manufacturer Assigned
operation requested list\" for a time duration that is implementation
specific, but IMEI/TACs are stored until the UCMF require to remove
certain TACs from the list (i.e. the list of IMEI/TACs which are
requested to use UE manufacturer-assigned IDs in the AMF and UCMF is
synchronised at all times).

\- The UCMF can request at any time the AMF to remove PLMN-assigned
ID(s) or IMEI/TAC(s) values from the UE manufacturer-assigned operation
requested list.

NOTE 3: The AMF can decide to remove a UE Radio Capability ID from the
\"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\" list e.g. because
no UE with that UE Radio Capability ID has connected to the network for
long time. If later a UE with such UE Radio Capability ID connects to
the network, the AMF contacts the UCMF to resolve the UE Radio
Capability ID, and at this point the UCMF can trigger again the deletion
of the UE Radio Capability ID by including this in the \"UE Manufacturer
Assigned operation requested list\" of the AMF.

The serving AMF stores the UE Radio Capability ID related to selected
PLMN for a UE in the UE context and provides this UE Radio Capability ID
to NG-RAN as part of the UE context information using N2 signalling.
During inter PLMN mobility, the new AMF shall delete the UE Radio
Capability ID received from the old AMF, unless the operator policy
indicates that all UE Radio Capability IDs used in the old PLMN is also
valid in the new PLMN.

NOTE 4: If AMF decides to allocate TAIs of multiple PLMN IDs as part of
Registration Area to the UE then AMF provides the UE Radio Capability ID
of the new selected PLMN to the NG-RAN during UE mobility, whether the
UE Radio Capability ID is taken from stored UE context previously
assigned by the same new selected PLMN or generated freshly each time a
new PLMN is selected is up to AMF implementation.

The UE stores the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in non-volatile
memory when in RM-DEREGISTERED state and can use it again when it
registers in the same PLMN.

NOTE 5: It is assumed that UE does not need to store the access stratum
information (i.e. UE-E-UTRA-Capability and UE-NR-Capability specified in
TS 36.331 \[51\] and TS 38.331 \[28\], respectively) that was indicated
by the UE to the network when the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
was assigned by the network. However, it is assumed that the UE does
store the related UE configuration (e.g. whether or not GERAN or UTRAN
or MBMS is enabled/disabled).

At any given time at most one UE Radio Capability ID is used from the UE
context in CN and RAN which is related to the selected PLMN.

The number of PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs that the UE stores
in non-volatile memory is left up to UE implementation. However, to
minimise the load (e.g. from radio signalling) on the Uu interface and
to provide smoother inter-PLMN mobility (e.g. at land borders) the UE
shall be able to store at least the latest 16 PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs (along with the PLMN that assigned them). This number is
independent of the UE manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s)
the UE may store.

It shall be possible for a UE to change, e.g. upon change in its usage
settings, the set of UE radio capabilities in time and signal the
associated UE Radio Capability ID, if available. The UE stores the
mapping between the UE Radio Capability ID and the corresponding UE
Radio Capability Information for every UE Radio Capability ID it stores.

If the UE\'s Radio Capability Information changes and regardless of
whether the UE has an associated UE Radio Capability ID for the updated
UE Radio Capability information, the UE shall perform the Registration
procedure by sending a Registration Request message to the AMF with the
Registration type set to Mobility Registration Update which includes
\"UE Radio Capability Update\" and:

\- If the UE has an associated UE Radio Capability ID for the updated UE
Radio Capability information, the UE shall include it in the
Registration Request message so that the AMF, upon receiving it, shall
update the UE\'s context with this UE Radio Capability ID.

\- If the UE does not have an associated UE Radio Capability ID for the
updated UE Radio Capability information, the UE shall not include any UE
Radio Capability ID in the Registration Request message so that the AMF,
upon receiving this Registration Request without any UE Radio Capability
ID, retrieves the UE radio capabilities from the UE as defined in
clause 5.4.4.1.

The NG-RAN may apply RRC filtering of UE radio capabilities when it
retrieves the UE Radio Capability Information from the UE as defined in
TS 38.331 \[28\].

NOTE 6: In a RACS supporting PLMN, the filter of UE radio capabilities
configured in NG-RAN is preferably as wide in scope as possible (e.g.
PLMN-wide). In this case, it corresponds e.g. to the super-set of bands,
band-combinations and RATs the PLMN deploys and not only to the specific
NG-RAN node or region.

NOTE 7: If the filter, included in the UE Radio Capability information,
of UE radio capabilities configured in two NG-RAN nodes is different,
during handover between these two nodes, it is possible that the target
NG-RAN node might need to enquire the UE for its UE Radio Capability
Information again and trigger re-allocation of a PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability ID leading to extra signalling. Additionally, a narrow filter
might reduce the list of candidate target nodes.

If a UE supports both NB-IoT and other RATs that do support RACS (e.g.
WB-E-UTRA and/or NR) then (since there is no support for RACS in NB-IoT)
the UE handles the RACS procedures as follows:

\- NB-IoT specific UE Radio Capability Information is handled in UE,
NG-RAN and AMF according to clause 5.4.4.1 and in EPS according to
TS 23.401 \[26\].

\- when the UE is not camping on NB-IoT, the RAN provides UE radio
capabilities for other RATs but not NB-IoT UE radio capabilities,
according to TS 38.300 \[27\] and TS 36.300 \[30\]. As a result the UE
Radio Capability ID that is assigned by the network corresponds only to
the UE radio capabilities of the non-NB-IoT RATs. The UE uses the UE
Radio Capability IDs assigned only in Mobility Registration Update
procedures performed over non-NB-IoT RATs.

Support for RACS in EPS is defined in TS 23.401 \[26\].

#### 5.4.4.2 Void

#### 5.4.4.2a UE Radio Capability Match Request

If the AMF requires more information on the UE radio capabilities
support to be able to set the IMS voice over PS Session Supported
Indication (see clause 5.16.3), then the AMF may send a UE Radio
Capability Match Request message to the NG-RAN. This procedure is
typically used during the Registration Procedure or when AMF has not
received the Voice Support Match Indicator (as part of the 5GMM
Context).

NOTE: During the Registration Procedure, if the AMF does not already
have the UEs radio capabilities, and if the RAT where the UE is requires
the establishment of AN security context prior to retrieval of radio
capabilities, the AMF needs to initiate \"Initial Context Setup\"
procedure as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\] to provide the 5G-AN with
security context, before sending a UE Radio Capability Match Request
message.

#### 5.4.4.3 Paging assistance information

The paging assistance information contains UE radio related information
that assists the RAN for efficient paging. The Paging assistance
information contains:

a\) UE radio capability for paging information:

\- The UE Radio Capability for Paging Information contains information
derived by the NG-RAN node (e.g. band support information) from the UE
Radio Capability information. The AMF stores this information without
needing to understand its contents.

As the AMF only infrequently (e.g. at Initial Registration) prompts the
NG-RAN to retrieve and upload the UE radio capabilities i.e. UE Radio
Capability information to the AMF, and the AMF may be connected to more
than one NG-RAN RAT, it is the responsibility of the NG-RAN to ensure
that UE Radio Capability for Paging Information (which is derived by the
NG-RAN node) contains information on all NG-RAN RATs that the UE
supports in that PLMN. To assist the NG-RAN in this task, as specified
in TS 38.413 \[34\], the AMF provides its stored UE Radio Capability for
Paging Information in every NG-AP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message
sent to the NG-RAN.

\- The UE Radio Capability for Paging Information is maintained in the
core network, even during AMF reselection, and is stored in the UCMF
alongside the UE Radio Capability information associated to a UE Radio
Capability ID.

b\) Information On Recommended Cells And RAN nodes For Paging:

\- Information sent by the NG-RAN, and used by the AMF when paging the
UE to help determining the NG RAN nodes to be paged as well as to
provide the information on recommended cells to each of these RAN nodes,
in order to optimize the probability of successful paging while
minimizing the signalling load on the radio path.

\- The RAN provides this information during N2 release.

### 5.4.4a UE MM Core Network Capability handling

The UE MM Core Network Capability is split into the S1 UE network
capability (mostly for E-UTRAN access related core network parameters)
and the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability (mostly to include other UE
capabilities related to 5GCN or interworking with EPS) as defined in
TS 24.501 \[47\] and contains non radio-related capabilities, e.g. the
NAS security algorithms, etc. The S1 UE network capability is
transferred between all CN nodes at AMF to AMF, AMF to MME, MME to MME,
and MME to AMF changes. The UE 5GMM Core Network Capability is
transferred only at AMF to AMF changes.

In order to ensure that the UE MM Core Network Capability information
stored in the AMF is up to date (e.g. to handle the situation when the
USIM is moved into a different device while out of coverage, and the old
device did not send the Detach message; and the cases of inter-RAT
Registration Area Update), the UE shall send the UE MM Core Network
Capability information to the AMF during the Initial Registration and
Mobility Registration Update procedure within the NAS message.

The AMF shall store always the latest UE MM Core Network Capability
received from the UE. Any UE MM Core Network Capability that an AMF
receives from an old AMF/MME is replaced when the UE provides the UE MM
Core Network Capability with Registration signalling.

If the UE\'s UE MM Core Network Capability information changes (in
either CM-CONNECTED or in CM-IDLE state), the UE shall perform a
Mobility Registration Update procedure when it next returns to NG-RAN
coverage. See clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The UE shall indicate in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability if the UE
supports:

\- Attach in EPC with Request type \"Handover\" in PDN CONNECTIVITY
Request message (clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[26\]).

\- EPC NAS.

\- SMS over NAS.

\- LCS.

\- 5G SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN, as specified in TS 23.216 \[88\].

\- Radio Capabilities Signalling optimisation (RACS).

\- Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization.

\- Parameters in Supported Network Behaviour for 5G CIoT as described in
clause 5.31.2.

\- Receiving WUS Assistance Information (E-UTRA) see clause 5.4.9..

\- Paging Subgrouping Support Indication (NR) see clause 5.4.12.

\- CAG, see clause 5.30.3.3.

\- Subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of
network slices (see clause 5.15.12).

\- Support of NSAG (see clause 5.15.14).

\- Minimization of Service Interruption (MINT), as described in
clause 5.40.

If a UE operating two or more USIMs, supports and intends to use one or
more Multi-USIM features (see clause 5.38) in a PLMN for a USIM, it
shall indicate in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability for this USIM in
this PLMN that it supports these one or more Multi-USIM features with
the following indications:

\- Connection Release Supported.

\- Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service Supported.

\- Reject Paging Request Supported.

\- Paging Restriction Supported.

Otherwise, the UE with the capabilities of Multi-USIM features but does
not intend to use them shall not indicate support of these one or more
Multi-USIM features.

A UE not operating two or more USIMs shall indicate the Multi-USIM
features are not supported.

NOTE: It is not necessary for a UE operating two or more USIMs to use
Multi-USIM features with all USIMs.

### 5.4.4b UE 5GSM Core Network Capability handling

The UE 5GSM Core Network Capability is included in PDU Session
Establishment/Modification Request.

The UE shall indicate in the UE 5GSM Core Network Capability whether the
UE supports:

\- \"Ethernet\" PDU Session Type supported in EPC as PDN Type
\"Ethernet\";

\- Reflective QoS;

\- Multi-homed IPv6 PDU Session (only if the Requested PDU Type was set
to \"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\");

\- ATSSS capability (as referred to clause 5.32.2);

\- Transfer of Port Management Information containers.

The 5GSM Core Network Capability is transferred, if needed, from V-SMF
to H-SMF during PDU Session Establishment/Modification procedure.

After the first inter-system change from EPS to 5GS for a PDU session
established in EPS, the 5GSM Core Network Capability is also included in
the PDU Session Modification if the Reflective QoS and/or Multi-homed
IPv6 PDU Session is present.

### 5.4.5 DRX (Discontinuous Reception) framework

The 5G System supports DRX architecture which allows Idle mode DRX cycle
is negotiated between UE and the AMF. The Idle mode DRX cycle applies in
CM-IDLE state and in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state.

If the UE wants to use UE specific DRX parameters, the UE shall include
its preferred values consistently in every Initial Registration and
Mobility Registration procedure separately for NR/WB-EUTRA and NB-IoT.
During Initial Registration and Mobility Registration procedures
performed on NB-IoT cells, the normal 5GS procedures apply. For NB-IoT,
the cell broadcasts an indication of support of UE specific DRX for
NB-IoT in that cell, and the UE can request UE specific DRX for NB-IoT
in the Registration procedure irrespective of whether the cell
broadcasts that support indication.

The AMF shall determine Accepted DRX parameters based on the received UE
specific DRX parameters and the AMF should accept the UE requested
values, but subject to operator policy the AMF may change the UE
requested values.

The AMF shall respond to the UE with the Accepted DRX parameters
separately for NR/WB-EUTRA and NB-IoT.

For details of DRX parameters, see TS 38.331 \[28\] and
TS 36.331 \[51\].

The UE shall apply the DRX cycle broadcast in the cell by the RAN unless
it has received Accepted DRX parameters for the RAT from the AMF and for
NB-IoT the cell supports UE specific DRX for NB-IoT, in which case the
UE shall apply either the DRX cycle broadcast in the cell or the
Accepted DRX parameters for the RAT, as defined in TS 38.304 \[50\] and
TS 36.304 \[52\].

The Periodic Registration procedure does not change the UE\'s DRX
settings.

In CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE applies either the DRX
cycle negotiated with AMF, or the DRX cycle broadcast by RAN or the UE
specific DRX cycle configured by RAN, as defined in TS 38.300 \[27\] and
TS 38.304 \[50\].

### 5.4.6 Core Network assistance information for RAN optimization

#### 5.4.6.1 General

Core Network assistance information for RAN aids the RAN to optimize the
UE state transition steering and the RAN paging strategy formulation in
RRC Inactive state. The Core Network assistance information includes the
information set, Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning, which
assist RAN optimize the UE RRC state transition and CM state transition
decision. It also includes the information set, Core Network assisted
RAN paging information, which assist RAN to formulate an optimized
paging strategy when RAN paging is triggered.

#### 5.4.6.2 Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning

Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning aids the RAN to minimize the
UE state transitions and achieve optimum network behaviour. How the RAN
uses the CN assistance information is not defined in this specification.

Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning may be derived by the AMF
per UE in the AMF based on collection of UE behaviour statistics,
Expected UE Behaviour and/or other available information about the UE
(such as subscribed DNN, SUPI ranges, or other information). If the AMF
maintains Expected UE Behaviour parameters, Network Configuration
parameters (as described in clause 4.15.6.3 or 4.15.6.3a,
TS 23.502 \[3\]) or SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning, the
AMF may use this information for selecting the CN assisted RAN parameter
values. If the AMF is able to derive the Mobility Pattern of the UE (as
described in clause 5.3.4.2), the AMF may take the Mobility Pattern
information into account when selecting the CN assisted RAN parameter
values.

The SMF uses the SMF-Associated parameters (e.g. Expected UE Behaviour
parameters or Network Configuration parameters of the UE) to derive the
SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning. The SMF sends the SMF
derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning to the AMF during the PDU
Session establishment procedure and if the SMF-Associated parameters
change the PDU Session modification procedure is applied. The AMF stores
the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning in the PDU Session
level context. The AMF uses the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters
tuning to determine a PDU Session level \"Expected UE activity
behaviour\" parameters set, which may be associated with a PDU Session
ID, as described below in this clause.

The Expected UE Behaviour parameters or the Network Configuration
parameters can be provisioned by external party via the NEF to the AMF
or SMF, as described in clause 5.20.

The CN assisted RAN parameters tuning provides the RAN with a way to
understand the UE behaviour for these aspects:

\- \"Expected UE activity behaviour\", i.e. the expected pattern of the
UE\'s changes between CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE states or the duration of
CM-CONNECTED state. This may be derived e.g. from the statistical
information, or Expected UE Behaviour or from subscription information.
The AMF derives one or more sets of the \"Expected UE activity
behaviour\" parameters for the UE as follows:

\- AMF may derive and provide to the RAN a UE level of \"Expected UE
activity behaviour\" parameters set considering the Expected UE
Behaviour parameters or Network Configuration parameters received from
the UDM (see clauses 4.15.6.3 or 4.15.6.3a of TS 23.502 \[3\]) and the
SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning associated with a PDU
Session using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. This set of
\"Expected UE activity behaviour\" parameters is valid for the UE; and

\- AMF may provide to the RAN a PDU Session level \"Expected UE activity
behaviour\" parameters set, e.g. considering the SMF derived CN assisted
RAN parameters tuning, per established PDU Session. The PDU Session
level \"Expected UE activity behaviour\" set of parameters is associated
with and valid for a PDU Session ID. The RAN may consider the PDU
Session level \"Expected UE activity behaviour\" parameters when the
User Plane resources for the PDU Session are activated;

\- \"Expected HO behaviour\", i.e. the expected interval between
inter-RAN handovers. This may be derived by the AMF e.g. from the
Mobility Pattern information;

\- \"Expected UE mobility\", i.e. whether the UE is expected to be
stationary or mobile. This may be derived e.g. from the statistical
information or Expected UE Behaviour parameters or from subscription
information;

\- \"Expected UE moving trajectory\" which may be derived e.g. from the
statistical information or Expected UE Behaviour parameters or from
subscription information; or

\- \"UE Differentiation Information\" including the Expected UE
Behaviour parameters excluding the Expected UE moving trajectory (see
clause 4.15.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) to support Uu operation optimisation
for NB-IoT UE differentiation if the RAT type is NB-IoT.

The AMF decides when to send this information to the RAN as \"Expected
UE activity behaviour\" carried in N2 request over the N2 interface (see
TS 38.413 \[34\]).

NOTE: The calculation of the CN assistance information, i.e. the
algorithms used and related criteria, and the decision when it is
considered suitable and stable to send to the RAN are vendor specific.

#### 5.4.6.3 Core Network assisted RAN paging information

Core Network assisted RAN paging information aids the RAN to formulate a
RAN paging policy and strategy in RRC Inactive state, besides the PPI
and QoS information associated to the QoS Flows as indicated in
clause 5.4.3.

CN assisted RAN paging information may be derived by the AMF per UE
and/or per PDU Session based on collection of UE behaviour statistics,
Expected UE Behaviour and/or other available information about the UE
(such as subscribed DNN, SUPI ranges, Multimedia priority service),
and/or information received from other network functions when downlink
signalling is triggered.

The CN assisted RAN paging information consists of a service priority
(values 1 to 256) which provides AN with a way to understand how
important the downlink signalling is. The AMF derives this service
priority based on available information as described above. The method
to derive the service priority is implementation depended and can be
controlled by operator.

The Core Network may provide the CN assisted RAN paging information to
RAN in different occasions, e.g. during downlink N1 and N2 message
delivery, etc.

### 5.4.7 NG-RAN location reporting

NG-RAN supports the NG-RAN location reporting for the services that
require accurate cell identification (e.g. emergency services, lawful
intercept, charging) or for the UE mobility event notification service
subscribed to the AMF by other NFs. The NG-RAN location reporting may be
used by the AMF when the target UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. The NG-RAN
location reporting may be used by the AMF to determine the
geographically located TAI in the case of NR satellite access.

The AMF may request the NG-RAN location reporting with event reporting
type (e.g. UE location or UE presence in Area of Interest), reporting
mode and its related parameters (e.g. number of reporting).

If the AMF requests UE location, the NG-RAN reports the current UE
location (or last known UE location with time stamp if the UE is in RRC
Inactive state) based on the requested reporting parameter (e.g.
one-time reporting or continuous reporting).

If the AMF requests UE location, in the case of NR satellite access, the
NG-RAN provides all broadcast TAIs to the AMF as part of the ULI. The
NG-RAN also reports the TAI where the UE is geographically located if
this TAI can be determined.

If the AMF requests UE presence in the Area Of Interest, the NG-RAN
reports the UE location and the indication (i.e. IN, OUT or UNKNOWN)
when the NG-RAN determines the change of UE presence in Area Of
Interest.

After N2 based Handover, if the NG-RAN location reporting information is
required, the AMF shall re-request the NG-RAN location reporting to the
target NG-RAN node. For Xn based Handover, the source NG-RAN shall
transfer the requested NG-RAN location reporting information to target
NG-RAN node.

The AMF requests the location information of the UE either through
independent N2 procedure (i.e. NG-RAN location reporting as specified in
clause 4.10 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), or by including the request in some
specific N2 messages as specified in TS 38.413 \[34\].

### 5.4.8 Support for identification and restriction of using unlicensed spectrum

Support for NG-RAN using unlicensed spectrum is defined in
TS 38.300 \[27\] and TS 36.300 \[30\].

For NG-RAN, in the case of NR in stand-alone mode, all cells are in
unlicensed spectrum and the NR is used as primary RAT. NR or E-UTRA
cells in unlicensed spectrum, can be used as secondary cells as
specified in the Dual Connectivity architecture defined in clause 5.11
or in addition can be configured to support the Carrier Aggregation
Architecture (CA) defined in TS 38.300 \[27\] and TS 36.300 \[30\].

For either case the serving PLMN can enforce Access Restriction for
Unlicensed Spectrum (either signalled from the UDM, or, locally
generated by VPLMN policy in the AMF) with the following:

\- To restrict the use of NR in unlicensed spectrum as primary RAT, the
AMF rejects the UE Registration procedure with appropriate cause code
defined in TS 24.501 \[47\] if the UE performs initial access from NR
using unlicensed spectrum. If the UE is accessing through some other
allowed RAT, the AMF signals this access restriction to NG-RAN as part
of Mobility Restriction List.

\- To restrict the use of use of unlicensed spectrum with NR or E-UTRA
as secondary RAT using Dual Connectivity or Carrier Aggregation
Architecture (CA) defined in TS 38.300 \[27\] and TS 36.300 \[30\], the
AMF signals this access restriction to NG-RAN as part of Mobility
Restriction List.

An NG-RAN node supporting aggregation with unlicensed spectrum using
either NR or E-UTRA checks whether the UE is allowed to use unlicensed
spectrum based on received Mobility Restriction List. If the UE is not
allowed to use Unlicensed Spectrum, the NG-RAN node shall restrict the
using of unlicensed spectrum, either NR or E-UTRA as secondary RATs when
using either Dual Connectivity or Carrier Aggregation (CA) as defined in
TS 38.300 \[27\] and TS 36.300 \[30\].

At inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN/EPS, the Access Restriction for
Unlicensed Spectrum is either already in the AMF\'s UE context, or is
obtained from the UDM during the subsequent Registration Area Update
procedure (i.e. not from the source MME or source RAN). In both
inter-RAT handover cases, any Access Restriction for use of Unlicensed
Spectrum is then signalled to NG-RAN or enforced in AMF.

NOTE: This signalling of the Access Restriction during the Registration
Area Update after the inter-RAT handover procedure means that there is a
small risk that unlicensed spectrum resources are transiently allocated.

When the UE is accessing 5GS using unlicensed spectrum as primary RAT:

\- The NG-RAN node shall provide an indication to the AMF in N2
interface that NR access is using unlicensed spectrum as defined in
TS 38.413 \[34\].

\- In order to restrict access to NR in unlicensed spectrum, cells
supporting NR in unlicensed spectrum have to be deployed in Tracking
Area(s) different to cells supporting licensed spectrum.

\- When the AMF receives an indication from NG-RAN over N2 whether NR in
unlicensed spectrum is being used as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\], the
AMF provides to the SMF an indication that the RAT type is NR with usage
of unlicensed spectrum during PDU Session Establishment or as part of
the UP activation and Handover procedures.

\- The PCF will also receive the indication whether the UE is using NR
in unlicensed spectrum, when applicable, from the SMF during SM Policy
Association Establishment or SM Policy Association Modification
procedure.

\- The NFs generating CDRs shall include the indication that the UE is
using NR in unlicensed spectrum in their CDRs.

When the UE is accessing NR or E-UTRA using unlicensed spectrum as
secondary RAT, procedures for Usage Data Reporting for Secondary RAT as
defined in clause 5.12.2 can apply.

### 5.4.9 Wake Up Signal Assistance

#### 5.4.9.1 General

The RAN and UE may use a Wake Up Signal (WUS) to reduce the UE\'s idle
mode power consumption. The RAN sends the WUS shortly before the UE\'s
paging occasion. The WUS feature enables UEs to determine that in the
paging occasions immediately following their WUS occasion they will not
be paged if their WUS is not transmitted, or that they might be paged if
their WUS is transmitted (see TS 36.304 \[52\]).

To avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple
cells (e.g. due to frequent UE mobility and/or for low paging latency
services such as VoLTE), the use of WUS by the ng-eNB and the UE is
restricted to the last used cell, i.e. the cell in which the UE\'s RRC
connection was last released. To support this:

a\) ng-eNBs should provide the Recommended Cells for Paging IE in the
*Information on Recommended Cells and RAN Nodes for Paging IE* (see
TS 38.413 \[34\]) to the AMF in the NGAP UE Context Release Complete, UE
Context Suspend Request and UE Context Resume Request messages;

b\) if received during the last NGAP UE Context Release Complete or UE
Context Suspend Request message, the AMF provides (without modification)
the *Recommended Cells for Paging as Assistance Data for Recommended
Cells IE in the Assistance Data for Paging IE* within the NGAP Paging
message to the RAN (see also TS 38.413 \[34\]); and

c\) the AMF shall delete (or mark as invalid) the *Information On
Recommended Cells And RAND nodes For Paging* when a new NGAP association
is established for the UE.

In the NGAP Paging message, the last used cell ID is sent in the
*Assistance Data for Recommended Cells IE* in the *Assistance Data for
Paging IE* (see TS 38.413 \[34\]). When receiving an NGAP Paging message
for a WUS-capable UE that also includes the *Assistance Data for
Recommended Cells IE* then a WUS-capable ng-eNB shall only broadcast the
WUS on the cell that matches the last used cell ID.

#### 5.4.9.2 Group Wake Up Signal

To support the Wake Up Signal (WUS), the WUS Assistance Information is
used by the ng-eNB to help determine the WUS group used when paging the
UE (see TS 36.300 \[30\]).

The content of the WUS Assistance Information consists of the paging
probability information. The paging probability information provides a
metric on the probability of a UE receiving a paging message based on,
e.g. statistical information.

The UE may in the Registration Request message provide its capability to
support receiving WUS Assistance Information. If WUS Assistance
Information is supported by the UE, then the UE in the Registration
Request message may provide the additional UE paging probability
information. The AMF may use the UE provided paging probability, local
configuration and/or previous statistical information for the UE, when
determining the WUS Assistance Information. If the UE supports WUS
Assistance Information, the AMF may assign WUS Assistance Information to
the UE, even when the UE has not provided the additional UE paging
probability information.

If the AMF has determined WUS Assistance Information for the UE, the AMF
provides it to the UE in every Registration Accept message. The AMF
stores the WUS Assistance Information parameter in the MM context and
provides it to the ng-eNB when paging the UE.

UE and AMF shall not signal WUS Assistance Information in Registration
Request, Registration Accept messages when the UE has an active
emergency PDU session.

### 5.4.10 Support for identification and restriction of using NR satellite access

Support for NR satellite access is specified in TS 38.300 \[27\].

Editor\'s note: TS 38.300 \[27\] not yet updated by RAN groups.

The AMF determines the RAT Type for NR satellite access, i.e. NR(LEO),
NR(MEO), NR(GEO) and NR(OTHERSAT). When the UE is accessing NR using
satellite access, an indication is provided in N2 interface indicating
the type of NR satellite access, as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\].

Editor\'s note: Further details on what type of satellite platforms
OTHERSAT includes is FFS and to be aligned with RAN WG3.

The serving PLMN can enforce mobility restrictions for NR satellite
access as specified in clause 5.3.4.1.

In order to enable efficient enforcement of Mobility Restrictions, cells
of each NR satellite RAT Type (NR(LEO), NR(MEO), NR(GEO) or
NR(OTHERSAT)) need to be deployed in TAs different from TAs for other NR
satellite RAT Types as well as different from TAs supporting terrestrial
access RAT Types.

The AMF may initiate deregistration of the UE when an N2 UE Context
Release Request is received with cause value indicating that the UE is
not in PLMN serving area, as specified in TS 38.413 \[34\].

### 5.4.11 Support for integrating NR satellite access into 5GS

#### 5.4.11.1 General

This clause describes the specific aspects for NR satellite access.

#### 5.4.11.2 Support of RAT types defined in 5GC for satellite access

In case of NR satellite access, the RAT Types values \"NR(LEO)\",
\"NR(MEO)\", \"NR(GEO)\" and \"NR(OTHERSAT)\" are used in 5GC to
distinguish the different NR satellite access types (see clause 5.4.10).

When a UE is accessing to the network via satellite access, the AMF
determines the RAT type as specified in clause 5.4.10.

#### 5.4.11.3 Void

#### 5.4.11.4 Verification of UE location

In order to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met, the network
may be configured to enforce that the selected PLMN is allowed to
operate in the current UE location by verifying the UE location during
Mobility Management and Session Management procedures. In this case,
when the AMF receives a NGAP message containing User Location
Information for a UE using NR satellite access, the AMF may decide to
verify the UE location. If the AMF determines based on the Selected PLMN
ID and ULI (including Cell ID) received from the gNB that it is not
allowed to operate at the present UE location the AMF should reject any
NAS request with a suitable cause value. If the UE is already registered
to the network when the AMF determines that it is not allowed to operate
at the present UE location, the AMF may initiate deregistration of the
UE. The AMF should not reject the request or deregister the UE unless it
has sufficiently accurate UE location information to determine that the
UE is located in a geographical area where the PLMN is not allowed to
operate.

NOTE: The area where the UE is allowed to operate can be determined
based on the regulatory area where the PLMN is allowed to operate based
on its licensing conditions.

If the AMF, based on the ULI, is not able to determine the UE\'s
location with sufficient accuracy to make a final decision, the AMF
proceeds with the Mobility Management or Session Management procedure
and may initiate UE location procedure after the Mobility Management or
Session Management procedure is complete, as specified in clause 6.10.1
of TS 23.273 \[87\], to determine the UE location. The AMF shall be
prepared to deregister the UE if the information received from LMF
indicates that the UE is registered to a PLMN that is not allowed to
operate in the UE location. In the case of a NAS procedure, the AMF
should either reject any NAS request targeted towards a PLMN that is not
allowed to operate in the known UE location and indicate a suitable
cause value, or accept the NAS procedure and initiate deregistration
procedure once the UE location is known. In the deregistration message
to the UE, the AMF shall include a suitable cause value. For UE
processing of the cause value indicating that the PLMN is not allowed to
operate in the current UE location, see TS 23.122 \[17\] and
TS 24.501 \[47\].

In the case of a handover procedure, if the (target) AMF determines that
it is not allowed to operate at the current UE location, the AMF either
rejects the handover, or accepts the handover and later deregisters the
UE.

#### 5.4.11.5 Network selection for NR satellite access

Network selection principles specified in clause 5.2.2 apply also for NR
satellite access.

For NR satellite access, a UE with location capability should use its
awareness of its location to select a PLMN that is allowed to operate in
the UE location as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\].

In order to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met, the network
may be configured to enforce this UE choice by verifying the UE
location, as described in clause 5.4.11.4.

#### 5.4.11.6 Support of Mobility Registration Update

A moving radio cell for NR satellite access may indicate support for one
or more TACs for each PLMN. A UE that is registered with a PLMN may
access a radio cell and does not need to perform a Mobility Registration
Update procedure as long as at least one supported TAC for the RPLMN or
equivalent to the RPLMN is part of the UE Registration Area. A UE shall
perform a Mobility Registration Update procedure when accessing a radio
cell where none of the supported TACs for the RPLMN or equivalent to the
RPLMN are part of the UE Registration Area.

When indicating a last visited TAI in a Registration Update, a UE may
indicate any TAI supported in a radio cell for the RPLMN or equivalent
to the RPLMN for the last UE access prior to the Registration Update
that is part of the UE Registration Area.

#### 5.4.11.7 Tracking Area handling for NR satellite access

Editor\'s note: References to RAN TSs are needed after RAN WGs have
further progressed their work on TA handling in NTN.

In the case of NR satellite access with moving cells, in order to ensure
that each TA is Earth-stationary even if the radio cells are moving
across the Earth\'s surface, the NG-RAN may change the TAC values that
are broadcast in a cell\'s system information as the cell moves, as
described in TS 38.331 \[28\].

NG-RAN may broadcast in a cell a single TAC per PLMN and change that TAC
value as the cell moves. Alternatively, the NG-RAN may broadcast in a
cell more than one TAC for a PLMN and add or remove TAC values as the
cell moves. The NG-RAN provides either the single broadcast TAI or all
broadcast TAIs corresponding to the Selected PLMN as described in
TS 38.413 \[34\] to the AMF as part of the ULI, whenever the ULI is
included in the NGAP message as described in TS 38.413 \[34\]. The
NG-RAN indicates, if known, also the TAI where the UE is geographically
located.

NOTE: The AMF may take the TAI where the UE is geographically located
into account to generate a suitable Registration Area for the UE.

#### 5.4.11.8 Support for mobility Forbidden Area and Service Area Restrictions for NR satellite access

Forbidden Area functionality is supported as described in
clause 5.3.4.1.1 with the modifications described below:

\- The AMF and the UE receive the broadcast TAI (if a single TAI is
broadcast) or all broadcast TAIs (if multiple TAIs are broadcast) from
the NG-RAN as described clause 5.4.11.7. The AMF considers the UE to be
in a Forbidden Area if the only received TAI is forbidden or if all
received TAIs are forbidden based on subscription data. The UE considers
it is in a Forbidden Area if the only received TAI is forbidden, or if
all received TAIs are forbidden and is not within a Forbidden Area in
the case that at least one broadcast TAI is not forbidden.

\- If AMF receives multiple TAIs from the NG-RAN and determines that
some, but not all of them are forbidden by subscription or by operator
policy, the AMF shall send the forbidden TAI(s) to the UE as described
in clauses 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.3 in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The UE stores the
TAI(s) in the appropriate Forbidden Area list and removes the TAI(s)
from Registration Area if present.

Service Area Restrictions functionality is supported as described in
clause 5.3.4.1.2 with the modifications described below:

\- The AMF receives the broadcast TAI (if a single TAI is broadcast) or
all broadcast TAIs (if multiple TAIs are broadcast) from the NG-RAN as
described clause 5.4.11.7. The AMF provides the UE with Service Area
Restrictions which consist of either Allowed Areas or Non-Allowed Areas,
as described in clause 5.3.4.1.2. The UE and AMF consider the UE to be
in a Non-Allowed Area if none of the broadcast TAIs is Allowed. The UE
and AMF consider the UE to be in an Allowed Area if at least one
broadcast TAI is allowed.

### 5.4.12 Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping Assistance

#### 5.4.12.1 General

The RAN and UE may use a Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping
(PEIPS) to reduce the UE\'s power consumption in RRC_IDLE and
RRC_INACTIVE over NR (see TS 38.304 \[50\]).

The paging subgrouping can be based on either the UE\'s temporary ID or
a Paging Subgroup ID allocated by the AMF. Paging subgrouping based on
the UE\'s temporary ID is implemented within the NG-RAN. For paging
subgrouping based on UE\'s temporary ID, the UE\'s support is included
in the UE Radio Capability for Paging, either derived by the NG-RAN from
UE provided UE radio capability (see clause 5.4.4) or based on UE Radio
Capability ID if UE radio capability signalling optimisation is used
(see clause 5.4.4.1a).

The AMF, when determining its paging strategy (see clause 5.4.3), should
take into consideration whether a gNB is using Paging subgrouping based
on the UE\'s temporary ID.

NOTE: Paging messages sent to that gNB can increase UE power consumption
for other UEs that support Paging Subgrouping based on the UE\'s
temporary ID.

If paging subgroups are being allocated by the AMF, then all AMFs
connected to one gNB (including the AMFs in different PLMNs using 5G
MOCN network sharing) shall use a consistent policy in allocating UEs to
the paging subgroups. The AMF may configure up to 8 different Paging
Subgroup IDs.

NOTE: Because the UE uses the AMF allocated paging subgroup across all
cells in its TAI-list, and, different, overlapping TAI lists can be
allocated to different UEs, then to avoid UE power consumption
increasing, it is likely to be necessary that all AMFs with an
overlapping coverage area use a consistent policy in allocating UEs to
the paging subgroups.

The NG-RAN node and the UE determine per cell which paging subgrouping
method to use as defined in TS 38.304 \[50\] and TS 38.331 \[28\].

#### 5.4.12.2 Core Network Assistance for PEIPS

To support the Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping (PEIPS),
Paging Subgrouping Support Indication and the PEIPS Assistance
Information is used by the AMF and NG-RAN to help determine whether
PEIPS applies to the UE and which paging subgroup used when paging the
UE (see TS 38.300 \[27\]).

In the Registration Request message, the Paging Subgrouping Support
Indication indicates whether the UE supports PEIPS with AMF PEIPS
Assistance Information. If the UE includes Paging Subgrouping Support
Indication, the UE may also include the paging probability information
to assist the AMF. If the AMF supports PEIPS assistance and if the UE
provided Paging Subgrouping Support Indication, the AMF stores the
indication in the UE context in AMF. The AMF may use local
configuration, the UE\'s paging probability information if provided,
information provided by the RAN (e.g. any of the *Information On
Recommended Cells And RAN nodes For Paging*), and/or previous
statistical information for the UE to determine the AMF PEIPS Assistance
Information. The AMF PEIPS Assistance Information includes the Paging
Subgroup ID.

NOTE 1: To minimise MT voice call setup latency, the AMF could allocate
Paging Subgroup IDs taking into account whether or not the UE is likely
to receive IMS voice over PS session calls.

NOTE 2: To avoid MT traffic for more mobile UEs causing more stationary
UEs to be woken up, the AMF could allocate Paging Subgroup IDs taking
into account the UE\'s mobility pattern.

If the AMF has determined AMF PEIPS Assistance Information for the UE,
the AMF stores it in the UE context in AMF and provides it to the UE in
every Registration Accept message.

If the AMF has determined AMF PEIPS Assistance Information, the AMF
shall provide it to NG RAN when paging the UE. In addition, in order to
support PEIPS for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE mode, the AMF shall provide the
AMF PEIPS Assistance Information to NG-RAN as part of the RRC Inactive
Assistance Information.

The NG-RAN chooses on a per-cell basis whether to use PEIPS and which
paging subgrouping mechanism to use. When using AMF allocated subgroups,
both the UE and NG-RAN use the AMF PEIPS Assistance Information to
determine the paging subgroup to apply as defined in TS 38.300 \[27\].

The AMF may use the UE Configuration Update procedure (as described in
clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) and N2 UE Context Modification
procedure (as described in clause 8.3.4 of TS 38.413 \[34\]) to update
the AMF PEIPS Assistance Information in the UE and NG-RAN.

When the UE has an active emergency PDU Session:

\- The UE shall not signal Paging Subgrouping Support Indication in the
Registration Request message.

## 5.5 Non-3GPP access specific aspects

### 5.5.0 General

This clause describe the specific aspects for untrusted non-3GPP access,
trusted non-3GPP access and W-5GAN access.

### 5.5.1 Registration Management

This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the
Untrusted Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access
network and to the W-5GAN. In the case of W-5GAN the UE mentioned in
this clause corresponds to 5G-RG or to the W-AGF in the case of FN-RG.
In the case of N5CW devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks,
the UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to TWIF.

The UE shall enter RM-DEREGISTERED state and the AMF shall enter
RM-DEREGISTERED state for the UE on non-3GPP access as follows:

\- at the UE and at the AMF, after performing an Explicit Deregistration
procedure;

\- at the AMF, after the Network non-3GPP Implicit Deregistration timer
has expired.

\- at the UE, after the UE non-3GPP Deregistration timer has expired.

NOTE: This is assumed to leave sufficient time to allow the UE to
re-activate UP connections for the established PDU Sessions over 3GPP or
non-3GPP access.

Whenever a UE registered over non-3GPP access enters CM-IDLE state for
the non-3GPP access, it starts the UE non-3GPP Deregistration timer
according to the value received from the AMF during a Registration
procedure.

Over non-3GPP access, the AMF runs the Network non-3GPP Implicit
Deregistration timer. The Network non-3GPP Implicit Deregistration timer
is started with a value longer than the UE\'s non-3GPP Deregistration
timer, whenever the CM state for the UE registered over non-3GPP access
changes to CM-IDLE for the non-3GPP access.

For a UE that is registered over Non-3GPP access, a change of the point
of attachment (e.g. change of WLAN AP) shall not lead the UE to perform
a Registration procedure.

A UE shall not provide 3GPP-specific parameters (e.g. indicate a
preference for MICO mode) during registration over a non-3GPP access.

### 5.5.2 Connection Management

This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the
Untrusted Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access
network and to the W-5GAN. The UE mentioned in this clause corresponds
to the 5G-RG in the case of W-5GAN and to the W-AGF in the case of
FN-RG. In the case of N5CW devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access
networks, the UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to TWIF.

A UE that successfully establishes a Non-3GPP Access Connection to the
5GC over a Non-3GPP access transitions to CM-CONNECTED state for the
Non-3GPP access.

In the case of Untrusted Non-3GPP access to 5GC, the Non-3GPP Access
Connection corresponds to an NWu connection.

In the case of Trusted access to 5GC, the Non-3GPP Access Connection
corresponds to an NWt connection.

In the case of N5CW devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks,
the Non-3GPP Access Connection corresponds to an Yt\' connection.

In the case of Wireline access to 5GC, the Non-3GPP Access Connection
corresponds to a Y4 connection and to Y5 connection.

A UE does not establish multiple simultaneous Non-3GPP Access Connection
to the 5GC.

The Non-3GPP Access Connection is released either as a result of an
Explicit Deregistration procedure or an AN Release procedure.

In the case of Untrusted Non-3GPP access, Trusted Non-3GPP access and
W-5GAN access to 5GC, the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF may in addition
explicitly release the NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 and Y5 signalling connection
due to NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 and Y5 connection failure, respectively. In
the case of NWu and NWt, the release may be determined by the \"dead
peer detection\" mechanism in IKEv2 defined in RFC 7296 \[60\]. In the
case of Y4 and Y5 the release may be detected for example by lost of
synchronisation of physical link, lost of PPPoE session, etc. Further
details on how NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 and Y5 connection failure is detected
is out of scope of 3GPP specifications.

For W-5GCAN, the W-AGF explicitly releases the N2 connection due to Y4
or Y5 connection failure, as determined by the \"dead peer detection\"
mechanism in DOCSIS MULPI \[89\].

The release of the Non-3GPP Access Connection between the UE and the
N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF shall be interpreted as follows:

\- By the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF as a criterion to release the N2
connection.

\- By the UE as a criterion for the UE to transition to CM-IDLE. A UE
registered over non-3GPP access remains in RM-REGISTERED state, unless
the Non-3GPP Access Connection release occurs as part of a
Deregistration procedure over non-3GPP access in which case the UE
enters the RM-DEREGISTERED state. When the UE in RM-REGISTERED
transitions to CM-IDLE, the UE non-3GPP Deregistration timer starts
running in the UE. The UE non-3GPP Deregistration timer stops when the
UE moves to CM-CONNECTED state or to the RM-DEREGISTERED state.

NOTE 1: When moved to CM-IDLE state over one access, the UE can attempt
to re-activate UP connections for the PDU Sessions over other access,
per UE policies and depending on the availability of these accesses.

NOTE 2: The release of the NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 or Y5 at the UE can occur
as a result of explicit signalling from the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF
respectively, e.g. IKE INFORMATION EXCHANGE in the case of NWu or as a
result of the UE detecting NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 or Y5 connection failure,
e.g. as determined by the \"dead peer detection\" mechanism in IKEv2 as
defined in RFC 7296 \[60\] for NWu, NWt and Yt\' or W-5GAN access
specific mechanism for Y4 and Y5. Further details on how the UE detects
NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 or Y5 connection failure is out of scope of 3GPP
specifications.

In the case of Non-3GPP access, when the AMF releases the N2 interface,
the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF shall release all the resources
associated with the UE including the Non-3GPP Access Connection with the
UE and its corresponding N3 resources. A release of the N2 connection by
the AMF shall set the CM state for the UE in the AMF to CM-IDLE.

NOTE 3: It is assumed that a UE configured to receive services from a
5GC over non-3GPP access that is RM-DEREGISTERED or CM-IDLE over the
non-3GPP access will attempt to establish Non-3GPP Access Connection and
transition to CM-CONNECTED state whenever the UE successfully connects
to a non-3GPP access unless prohibited by the network to make a N3GPP
Access Connection (e.g. due to network congestion).

An UE cannot be paged on Non-3GPP access network.

When a UE registered simultaneously over a 3GPP access and a non-3GPP
access moves all the PDU Sessions to one of the accesses, whether the UE
initiates a Deregistration procedure in the access that has no PDU
Sessions is up to the UE implementation.

Release of PDU Sessions over the non-3GPP access does not imply the
release of N2 connection.

When the UE has PDU Sessions routed over the non-3GPP access and the UE
state becomes CM-IDLE for the non-3GPP access, these PDU Sessions are
not released to enable the UE to move the PDU Sessions over the 3GPP
access based on UE policies. The core network maintains the PDU Sessions
but deactivates the N3 user plane connection for such PDU Sessions.

### 5.5.3 UE Reachability

#### 5.5.3.1 UE reachability in CM-IDLE

This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the
Untrusted Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access
network and to the W-5GAN. The UE mentioned in this clause corresponds
to 5G-RG, in the case of W-5GAN or to W-AGF in the case of support of
FN-RG. In the case of N5CW devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access
networks, the UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to TWIF.

An UE cannot be paged over Non-3GPP access network.

If the UE states in the AMF are CM-IDLE and RM-REGISTERED for the
non-3GPP access, there may be PDU Sessions that were last routed over
the non-3GPP access and without user plane resources. If the AMF
receives a message with a Non-3GPP Access Type indication from an SMF
for a PDU Session corresponding to a UE that is CM-IDLE for non-3GPP
access, and the UE is registered over 3GPP access in the same PLMN as
the one registered over non-3GPP access, a Network Triggered Service
Request may be performed over the 3GPP access independently of whether
the UE is CM-IDLE or CM-CONNECTED over the 3GPP access. In this case,
the AMF provides an indication that the procedure is related to non-3GPP
access, as specified in clause 5.6.8.

NOTE: The UE behaviour upon such network triggered Service Request is
specified in clause 5.6.8.

#### 5.5.3.2 UE reachability in CM-CONNECTED

This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the
Untrusted Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access
network and to the W-5GAN. In the case of W-5GAN the UE mentioned in
this clause corresponds to 5G-RG and to W-AGF in the case of support of
FN-RG. In the case of N5CW devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access
networks, the UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to TWIF.

For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state:

\- the AMF knows the UE location on a N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF node
granularity.

\- the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF releases the N2 connection when UE
becomes unreachable from N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF point of view, i.e.
upon Non-3GPP Access Connection release.

## 5.6 Session Management

### 5.6.1 Overview

The 5GC supports a PDU Connectivity Service i.e. a service that provides
exchange of PDUs between a UE and a data network identified by a DNN.
The PDU Connectivity Service is supported via PDU Sessions that are
established upon request from the UE.

The Subscription Information for each S-NSSAI may contain a Subscribed
DNN list and one default DNN. When the UE does not provide a DNN in a
NAS Message containing PDU Session Establishment Request for a given
S-NSSAI, the serving AMF determines the DNN for the requested PDU
Session by selecting the default DNN for this S-NSSAI if a default DNN
is present in the UE\'s Subscription Information; otherwise the serving
AMF selects a locally configured DNN for this S-NSSAI.

The expectation is that the URSP in the UE is always up to date using
the procedure defined in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] and
therefore the UE requested DNN will be up to date.

In order to cover cases that UE operates using local configuration, but
also other cases where operator policies can be used in order to replace
an \"up to date\" UE requested DNN with another DNN used only internally
in the network, during UE Registration procedure the PCF may indicate,
to the AMF, the operator policies to be used at PDU Session
Establishment for DNN replacement of a UE requested DNN. PCF may
indicate a policy for DNN replacement of UE requested DNNs not supported
by the network, and/or indicate a list of UE requested DNNs per S-NSSAI
valid for the serving network, that are subject for replacement (details
are described in TS 23.503 \[45\]).

If the DNN provided by the UE is not supported by the network and AMF
cannot select an SMF by querying NRF, the AMF shall reject the NAS
Message containing PDU Session Establishment Request from the UE with a
cause indicating that the DNN is not supported unless the PCF provided
the policy to perform a DNN replacement of unsupported DNNs.

If the DNN requested by the UE is indicated for replacement or the DNN
provided by the UE is not supported by the network and the PCF provided
the policy to perform DNN replacement of UE requested DNNs not supported
by the network, the AMF shall interact with the PCF to perform a DNN
replacement. During PDU Session Establishment procedure and as a result
of DNN replacement, the PCF provides the selected DNN that is applicable
for the S-NSSAI requested by the UE at the PDU Session Establishment.
The AMF uses the selected DNN in the query towards the NRF for the SMF
selection, as specified in clause 6.3.2, and provides both requested and
selected DNN to the selected SMF. For PDU Session with Home-routed
Roaming whether to perform DNN replacement is based on operator
agreements.

NOTE 1: The selected DNN is determined based on operator preferences and
can differ from subscribed DNNs. The matching of selected DNN to S-NSSAI
is assumed to be based on network configuration.

Each PDU Session supports a single PDU Session type i.e. supports the
exchange of a single type of PDU requested by the UE at the
establishment of the PDU Session. The following PDU Session types are
defined: IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet, Unstructured.

PDU Sessions are established (upon UE request), modified (upon UE and
5GC request) and released (upon UE and 5GC request) using NAS SM
signalling exchanged over N1 between the UE and the SMF. Upon request
from an Application Server, the 5GC is able to trigger a specific
application in the UE. When receiving that trigger message, the UE shall
pass it to the identified application in the UE. The identified
application in the UE may establish a PDU Session to a specific DNN, see
clause 4.4.5.

SMF may support PDU Sessions for LADN where the access to a DN is only
available in a specific LADN service area. This is further defined in
clause 5.6.5.

SMF may support PDU Sessions for a 5G VN group which offers a virtual
data network capable of supporting 5G LAN-type service over the 5G
system. This is further defined in clause 5.8.2.13.

The SMF is responsible of checking whether the UE requests are compliant
with the user subscription. For this purpose, it retrieves and requests
to receive update notifications on SMF level subscription data from the
UDM. Such data may indicate per DNN and per S-NSSAI of the HPLMN:

\- The allowed PDU Session Types and the default PDU Session Type.

\- The allowed SSC modes and the default SSC mode.

\- QoS Information (refer to clause 5.7): the subscribed Session-AMBR,
Default 5QI and Default ARP.

\- The IP Index information.

\- The static IP address/prefix.

\- The subscribed User Plane Security Policy.

\- the Charging Characteristics to be associated with the PDU Session.
Whether this information is provided by the UDM to a SMF in another PLMN
(for PDU Sessions in LBO mode) is defined by operator policies in the
UDM/UDR.

NOTE 2: The content of the Charging Characteristics as well as the usage
of the Charging Characteristics by the SMF are defined in
TS 32.255 \[68\].

A PDU Session may support:

\(a\) a single-access PDU Connectivity Service, in which case the PDU
Session is associated with a single access type at a given time, i.e.
either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access; or

\(b\) a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, in which case the PDU
Session is simultaneously associated with both 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access and simultaneously associated with two independent N3/N9 tunnels
between the PSA and RAN/AN.

A PDU Session supporting a single-access PDU Connectivity Service is
also referred to as single-access PDU Session, while a PDU Session
supporting a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service is referred to as
Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session and it is used to support the ATSSS
feature (see clause 5.32 for details).

A UE that is registered over multiple accesses chooses over which access
to establish a PDU Session. As defined in TS 23.503 \[45\], the HPLMN
may send policies to the UE to guide the UE selection of the access over
which to establish a PDU Session.

NOTE 3: In this Release of the specification, at any given time, a PDU
Session is routed over only a single access network, unless it is an MA
PDU Session in which case it can be routed over one 3GPP access network
and one Non 3GPP access network concurrently.

A UE may request to move a single-access PDU Session between 3GPP and
Non 3GPP accesses. The decision to move single-access PDU Sessions
between 3GPP access and Non 3GPP access is made on a per PDU Session
basis, i.e. the UE may, at a given time, have some PDU Sessions using
3GPP access while other PDU Sessions are using Non 3GPP access.

If the UE is attempting to move a single-access PDU session from 3GPP
access to non-3GPP access and the PDU session is associated with control
plane only indication, then the AMF shall reject the PDU Session
Establishment request as related CIoT 5GS optimisation features are not
supported over non-3GPP access as described in clause 5.4.5.2.5 of
TS 24.501 \[47\]. If the UE is attempting to move a single-access PDU
session from non-3GPP access to NB-N1 mode of 3GPP access, the PDU
Session Establishment request would also be rejected by AMF when the UP
resources for the UE exceed the maximum number of supported UP resources
as described in clause 5.4.5.2.4 of TS 24.501 \[47\].

In a PDU Session Establishment Request message sent to the network, the
UE shall provide a PDU Session ID. The PDU Session ID is unique per UE
and is the identifier used to uniquely identify one of a UE\'s PDU
Sessions. The PDU Session ID shall be stored in the UDM to support
handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP access when different PLMNs are used
for the two accesses. The UE also provides as described in
TS 24.501 \[47\]:

\(a\) PDU Session Type.

\(b\) S-NSSAI of the HPLMN that matches the application (that is
triggering the PDU Session Request) within the NSSP in the URSP rules or
within the UE Local Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of
TS 23.503 \[45\].

NOTE 4: If the UE cannot determine any S-NSSAI after performing the
association of the application to a PDU Session, then it does not
indicate any S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Establishment procedure as
defined in clause 5.15.5.3.

\(c\) S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN from the Allowed NSSAI, corresponding
to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN (b).

NOTE 5: Generally, in non-roaming scenario the mapping of the Allowed
NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs is not provided to the UE (because the S-NSSAI
of the Serving PLMN (c) has the same value of the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN
(b)), therefore the UE provides in the PDU Session Request only the
S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN (c). However, if the UE is provided with the
mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs even in non-roaming
scenario, then the UE provides in the PDU Session Request both the
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN (b) and the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI (c) that
maps to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN.

NOTE 6: In roaming scenarios the UE provides in the PDU Session Request
both the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN (b) and the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN from the
Allowed NSSAI (c) that maps to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN.

\(d\) DNN (Data Network Name).

\(e\) SSC mode (Service and Session Continuity mode defined in
clause 5.6.9.2).

Additionally, if the UE supports ATSSS and wants to activate a MA PDU
Session, the UE shall provide Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" and
shall indicate the supported ATSSS capabilities (see clause 5.32 for
details).

+--------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

Subscription Information may include a wildcard DNN per subscribed
S-NSSAI: when a wildcard DNN is associated with a subscribed S-NSSAI,
the subscription allows, for this S-NSSAI, the UE to establish a PDU
Session using any DNN value.

NOTE 7: The SMF is made aware whether the DNN of a PDU Session being
established corresponds to an explicitly subscribed DNN or corresponds
to a wildcard DNN. Thus, the SMF can reject a PDU Session establishment
if the DNN of the PDU Session is not part of explicitly subscribed
DNN(s) and local policies in the SMF require UE to have a subscription
to this DNN.

A UE may establish multiple PDU Sessions, to the same data network or to
different data networks, via 3GPP and via and Non-3GPP access networks
at the same time.

A UE may establish multiple PDU Sessions to the same Data Network and
served by different UPF terminating N6.

A UE with multiple established PDU Sessions may be served by different
SMF.

The SMF shall be registered and deregistered on a per PDU Session
granularity in the UDM.

The user plane paths of different PDU Sessions (to the same or to
different DNN) belonging to the same UE may be completely disjoint
between the AN and the UPF interfacing with the DN.

When the SMF cannot control the UPF terminating the N3 interface used by
a PDU Session and SSC mode 2/3 procedures are not applied to the PDU
Session, an I-SMF is inserted between the SMF and the AMF and handling
of PDU Session(s) is described in clause 5.34.

NOTE 8: User Plane resources for PDU Sessions of a UE, except for
regulatory prioritized service like Emergency Services and MPS, can be
deactivated by the SMF if the UE is only reachable for regulatory
prioritized services.

The SMF serving a PDU session (i.e. Anchor) can be changed during
lifetime of the PDU session either within the same SMF set or, if the
Context Transfer Procedures as specified in clause 4.26 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] are supported, between SMFs in different SMF sets.

### 5.6.2 Interaction between AMF and SMF

The AMF and SMF are separate Network Functions.

N1 related interaction with SMF is as follows:

\- The single N1 termination point is located in AMF. The AMF forwards
SM related NAS information to the SMF based on the PDU Session ID in the
NAS message. Further SM NAS exchanges (e.g. SM NAS message responses)
for N1 NAS signalling received by the AMF over an access (e.g. 3GPP
access or non-3GPP access) are transported over the same access.

\- The serving PLMN ensures that subsequent SM NAS exchanges (e.g. SM
NAS message responses) for N1 NAS signalling received by the AMF over an
access (e.g. 3GPP access or non-3GPP access) are transported over the
same access.

\- SMF handles the Session management part of NAS signalling exchanged
with the UE.

\- The UE shall only initiate PDU Session Establishment in RM-REGISTERED
state.

\- When a SMF has been selected to serve a specific PDU Session, AMF has
to ensure that all NAS signalling related with this PDU Session is
handled by the same SMF instance.

\- Upon successful PDU Session Establishment, the AMF and SMF stores the
Access Type that the PDU Session is associated.

N11 related interaction with SMF is as follows:

\- The AMF reports the reachability of the UE based on a subscription
from the SMF, including:

\- The UE location information with respect to the area of interest
indicated by the SMF.

\- The SMF indicates to AMF when a PDU Session has been released.

\- Upon successful PDU Session Establishment, AMF stores the
identification of serving SMF of UE and SMF stores the identification of
serving AMF of UE including the AMF set. When trying to reach the AMF
serving the UE, the SMF may need to apply the behaviour described for
\"the other CP NFs\" in clause 5.21.

N2 related interaction with SMF is as follows:

\- Some N2 signalling (such as handover related signalling) may require
the action of both AMF and SMF. In such case, the AMF is responsible to
ensure the coordination between AMF and SMF. The AMF may forward the SM
N2 signalling towards the corresponding SMF based on the PDU Session ID
in N2 signalling.

\- SMF shall provide PDU Session Type together with PDU Session ID to
NG-RAN, in order to facilitate NG-RAN to apply suitable header
compression mechanism to packet of different PDU type. Details refer to
TS 38.413 \[34\].

N3 related interaction with SMF is as follows:

\- Selective activation and deactivation of UP connection of existing
PDU Session is defined in clause 5.6.8.

N4 related interaction with SMF is as follows:

\- When it is made aware by the UPF that some DL data has arrived for a
UE without downlink N3 tunnel information, the SMF interacts with the
AMF to initiate Network Triggered Service Request procedure. In this
case, if the SMF is aware that the UE is unreachable or if the UE is
reachable only for regulatory prioritized service and the PDU Session is
not for regulatory prioritized service, then the SMF shall not inform DL
data notification to the AMF

The AMF is responsible of selecting the SMF per procedures described in
clause 6.3.2. For this purpose, it gets subscription data from the UDM
that are defined in that clause. Furthermore, it retrieves the
subscribed UE-AMBR from the UDM, and optionally dynamic serving network
UE-AMBR from PCF based on operator local policy, and sends to the (R)AN
as defined in clause 5.7.2

AMF-SMF interactions to support LADN are defined in clause 5.6.5.

In order to support charging and to fulfil regulatory requirement (in
order to provide NPLI (Network Provided Location Information) as defined
in TS 23.228 \[15\]) related with the set-up, modification and release
of IMS Voice calls or with SMS transfer the following applies

\- At the time of the PDU Session Establishment, the AMF provides the
SMF with the PEI of the UE if the PEI is available at the AMF.

\- When it forwards UL NAS or N2 signalling to a peer NF (e.g. to SMF or
to SMSF) or during the UP connection activation of a PDU Session, the
AMF provides any User Location Information it has received from the
5G-AN as well as the Access Type (3GPP - Non 3GPP) of the AN over which
it has received the UL NAS or N2 signalling. The AMF also provides the
corresponding UE Time Zone. In addition, in order to fulfil regulatory
requirement (i.e. providing Network Provided Location Information
(NPLI), as defined in TS 23.228 \[15\]) when the access is non-3GPP, the
AMF may also provide the last known 3GPP access User Location
Information with its age, if the UE is still attached to the same AMF
for 3GPP access (i.e. valid User Location Information).

The User Location Information, the access type and the UE Time Zone may
be further provided by SMF to PCF. The PCF may get this information from
the SMF in order to provide NPLI to applications (such as IMS) that have
requested it.

The User Location Information may correspond to:

\- In the case of 3GPP access: Cell-Id. The AMF includes only the
Primary Cell-Id even if it had received also the Cell-Id of the Primary
cell in the Secondary RAN node from NG-RAN.

\- In the case of Untrusted non-3GPP access: the UE local IP address
used to reach the N3IWF and optionally the UDP source port number if NAT
is detected.

\- In the case of Trusted non-3GPP access: TNAP/TWAP Identifier, the
UE/N5CW device local IP address used to reach the TNGF/TWIF and
optionally the UDP source port number if NAT is detected.

When the UE uses WLAN based on IEEE 802.11 technology to reach the TNGF,
the TNAP Identifier shall include the SSID of the access point to which
the UE is attached. The TNAP Identifier shall include at least one of
the following elements, unless otherwise determined by the TWAN
operator\'s policies:

\- the BSSID (see IEEE Std 802.11-2012 \[106\]);

\- civic address information of the TNAP to which the UE is attached.

The TWAP Identifier shall include the SSID of the access point to which
the NC5W is attached. The TWAP Identifier shall also include at least
one of the following elements, unless otherwise determined by the TWAN
operator\'s policies:

\- the BSSID (see IEEE Std 802.11-2012 \[106\]);

\- civic address information of the TWAP to which the UE is attached.

NOTE 1: The SSID can be the same for several TNAPs/TWAPs and SSID only
cannot provide a location, but it might be sufficient for charging.

NOTE 2: the BSSID associated with a TNAP/TWAP is assumed to be static.

\- In the case of W-5GAN access: The User Location Information for
W-5GAN is defined in TS 23.316 \[84\].

When the SMF receives a request to provide Access Network Information
reporting while there is no action to carry out towards the 5G-AN or the
UE (e.g. no QoS Flow to create / Update / modify), the SMF may request
User Location Information from the AMF.

The interaction between AMF and SMF(s) for the case of a I-SMF
insertion, relocation or removal for a PDU session is described in
clause 5.34.

### 5.6.3 Roaming

In the case of roaming the 5GC supports following possible deployments
scenarios for a PDU Session:

\- \"Local Break Out\" (LBO) where the SMF and all UPF(s) involved by
the PDU Session are under control of the VPLMN.

\- \"Home Routed\" (HR) where the PDU Session is supported by a SMF
function under control of the HPLMN, by a SMF function under control of
the VPLMN, by at least one UPF under control of the HPLMN and by at
least one UPF under control of the VPLMN. In this case the SMF in HPLMN
selects the UPF(s) in the HPLMN and the SMF in VPLMN selects the UPF(s)
in the VPLMN. This is further described in clause 6.3.

NOTE 1: The use of an UPF in the VPLMN e.g. enables VPLMN charging,
VPLMN LI and minimizes the impact on the HPLMN of the UE mobility within
the VPLMN (e.g. for scenarios where SSC mode 1 applies).

Different simultaneous PDU Sessions of an UE may use different modes:
Home Routed and LBO. The HPLMN can control via subscription data per DNN
and per S-NSSAI whether a PDU Session is to be set-up in HR or in LBO
mode.

In the case of PDU Sessions per Home Routed deployment:

\- NAS SM terminates in the SMF in VPLMN.

\- The SMF in VPLMN forwards to the SMF in the HPLMN SM related
information.

\- The SMF in the HPLMN receives the SUPI of the UE from the SMF in the
VPLMN during the PDU Session Establishment procedure.

\- The SMF in HPLMN is responsible to check the UE request with regard
to the user subscription and to possibly reject the UE request in the
case of mismatch. The SMF in HPLMN obtains subscription data directly
from the UDM.

\- The SMF in HPLMN may send QoS requirements associated with a PDU
Session to the SMF in VPLMN. This may happen during the PDU Session
Establishment procedure and after the PDU Session is established. The
interface between SMF in HPLMN and SMF in VPLMN is also able to carry
(N9) User Plane forwarding information exchanged between SMF in HPLMN
and SMF in VPLMN. The SMF in the VPLMN may check QoS requests from the
SMF in HPLMN with respect to roaming agreements.

In home routed roaming case, the AMF selects an SMF in the VPLMN and a
SMF in the HPLMN as described in clause 6.3.2 and in clause 4.3.2.2.3.3
of TS 23.502 \[3\], and provides the identifier of the selected SMF in
the HPLMN to the selected SMF in the VPLMN.

In roaming with LBO, the AMF selects a SMF in the VPLMN as described in
clause 6.3.2 and in clause 4.3.2.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. In this case,
when handling a PDU Session Establishment Request message, the SMF in
the VPLMN may reject the N11 message (related with the PDU Session
Establishment Request message) with a proper N11 cause. This triggers
the AMF to select both a new SMF in the VPLMN and a SMF in the HPLMN in
order to handle the PDU Session using home routed roaming.

### 5.6.4 Single PDU Session with multiple PDU Session Anchors

#### 5.6.4.1 General

In order to support selective traffic routing to the DN or to support
SSC mode 3 as defined in clause 5.6.9.2.3, the SMF may control the data
path of a PDU Session so that the PDU Session may simultaneously
correspond to multiple N6 interfaces. The UPF that terminates each of
these interfaces is said to support PDU Session Anchor functionality.
Each PDU Session Anchor supporting a PDU Session provides a different
access to the same DN. Further, the PDU Session Anchor assigned at PDU
Session Establishment is associated with the SSC mode of the PDU Session
and the additional PDU Session Anchor(s) assigned within the same PDU
Session e.g. for selective traffic routing to the DN are independent of
the SSC mode of the PDU Session. When a PCC rule including the AF
influenced Traffic Steering Enforcement Control information defined in
clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.503 \[45\] is provided to the SMF, the SMF can
decide whether to apply traffic routing (by using UL Classifier
functionality or IPv6 multi-homing) based on DNAI(s) included in the PCC
rule.

NOTE 1: AF influenced Traffic Steering Enforcement Control information
can be either determined by the PCF when requested by AF via NEF as
described in clause 5.6.7.1 or statically pre-configured in the PCF.

NOTE 2: Selective traffic routing to the DN supports, for example,
deployments where some selected traffic is forwarded on an N6 interface
to the DN that is \"close\" to the AN serving the UE.

This may correspond to

\- The Usage of UL Classifier functionality for a PDU Session defined in
clause 5.6.4.2.

\- The Usage of an IPv6 multi-homing for a PDU Session defined in
clause 5.6.4.3.

#### 5.6.4.2 Usage of an UL Classifier for a PDU Session

In the case of PDU Sessions of type IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 or Ethernet,
the SMF may decide to insert in the data path of a PDU Session an \"UL
CL\" (Uplink classifier). The UL CL is a functionality supported by an
UPF that aims at diverting (locally) some traffic matching traffic
filters provided by the SMF. The insertion and removal of an UL CL is
decided by the SMF and controlled by the SMF using generic N4 and UPF
capabilities. The SMF may decide to insert in the data path of a PDU
Session a UPF supporting the UL CL functionality during or after the PDU
Session Establishment, or to remove from the data path of a PDU Session
a UPF supporting the UL CL functionality after the PDU Session
Establishment. The SMF may include more than one UPF supporting the UL
CL functionality in the data path of a PDU Session.

The UE is unaware of the traffic diversion by the UL CL, and does not
involve in both the insertion and the removal of UL CL. In the case of a
PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, the UE associates the PDU
Session with either a single IPv4 address or a single IPv6 Prefix or
both of them allocated by the network.

When an UL CL functionality has been inserted in the data path of a PDU
Session, there are multiple PDU Session Anchors for this PDU Session.
These PDU Session Anchors provide different access to the same DN. In
the case of a PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, only one IPv4
address and/or IPv6 prefix is provided to the UE. The SMF may be
configured with local policies for some (DNN, S-NSSAI) combinations to
release the PDU Session when there is a PSA associated with the IPv4
address allocated to the UE and this PSA has been removed.

NOTE 0: The use of only one IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix with
multiple PDU Session Anchors assumes that when needed, appropriate
mechanisms are in place to correctly forward packets on the N6 reference
point. The mechanisms for packet forwarding on the N6 reference point
between the PDU Session Anchor providing local access and the DN are
outside the scope of this specification.

The UL CL provides forwarding of UL traffic towards different PDU
Session Anchors and merge of DL traffic to the UE i.e. merging the
traffic from the different PDU Session Anchors on the link towards the
UE. This is based on traffic detection and traffic forwarding rules
provided by the SMF.

The UL CL applies filtering rules (e.g. to examine the destination IP
address/Prefix of UL IP packets sent by the UE) and determines how the
packet should be routed. The UPF supporting an UL CL may also be
controlled by the SMF to support traffic measurement for charging,
traffic replication for LI and bit rate enforcement (Session-AMBR per
PDU Session).

NOTE 1: When N9 forwarding tunnel exists between source ULCL and target
ULCL, the Session-AMBR per PDU Session can be enforced by the source UL
CL UPF.

NOTE 2: The UPF supporting an UL CL may also support a PDU Session
Anchor for connectivity to the local access to the data network
(including e.g. support of tunnelling or NAT on N6). This is controlled
by the SMF.

Additional UL CLs (and thus additional PDU Session Anchors) can be
inserted in the data path of a PDU Session to create new data paths for
the same PDU Session. The way to organize the data path of all UL CLs in
a PDU Session is up to operator configuration and SMF logic and there is
only one UPF supporting UL CL connecting to the (R)AN via N3 interface,
except when session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used.

The insertion of an ULCL in the data path of a PDU Session is depicted
in Figure 5.6.4.2-1.

![](media/image61.emf)

Figure 5.6.4.2-1: User plane Architecture for the Uplink Classifier

NOTE 3: It is possible for a given UPF to support both the UL CL and the
PDU Session Anchor functionalities.

Due to UE mobility the network may need to relocate the UPF acting as UL
CL and establish a new PSA for local access to the DN. To support
session continuity during UL CL relocation the network may establish a
temporary N9 forwarding tunnel between the source UL CL and target UL
CL. The AF may influence the creation of the N9 forwarding tunnel as
described in clause 5.6.7.1.

The N9 forwarding tunnel is maintained until:

\- all active traffic flowing on it ceases to exist for:

\- a configurable period of time; or

\- a period of time indicated by the AF;

\- until the AF informs the SMF that it can release the source PSA
providing local access to the DN.

During the existence of the N9 forwarding tunnel the UPF acting as
target UL CL is configured with packet filters that:

\- force uplink traffic from existing data sessions between UE and the
application in the source local part of the DN (as defined in
TS 23.548 \[130\]) into the N9 forwarding tunnel towards the source UL
CL.

\- force any traffic related to the application in the target local part
of the DN to go to the new local part of the DN via the target PSA.

SMF may send a Late Notification to AF to inform it about the DNAI
change as described in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. This
notification can be used by the AF e.g. to trigger mechanisms in the
source local part of the DN to redirect the ongoing traffic sessions
towards an application in the target local part of the DN. SMF can also
send late notification to the target AF instance if associated with this
target local part of the DN.

The procedure for session continuity upon UL CL relocation is described
in clause 4.3.5.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

When an I-SMF is inserted for a PDU Session, the details of UL CL
insertion which is controlled by an I-SMF is described in clause 5.34.4.

#### 5.6.4.3 Usage of IPv6 multi-homing for a PDU Session

A PDU Session may be associated with multiple IPv6 prefixes. This is
referred to as multi-homed PDU Session. The multi-homed PDU Session
provides access to the Data Network via more than one PDU Session
Anchor. The different user plane paths leading to the different PDU
Session Anchors branch out at a \"common\" UPF referred to as a UPF
supporting \"Branching Point\" functionality. The Branching Point
provides forwarding of UL traffic towards the different PDU Session
Anchors and merge of DL traffic to the UE i.e. merging the traffic from
the different PDU Session Anchors on the link towards the UE.

The UPF supporting a Branching Point functionality may also be
controlled by the SMF to support traffic measurement for charging,
traffic replication for LI and bit rate enforcement (Session-AMBR per
PDU Session). The insertion and removal of a UPF supporting Branching
Point is decided by the SMF and controlled by the SMF using generic N4
and UPF capabilities. The SMF may decide to insert in the data path of a
PDU Session a UPF supporting the Branching Point functionality during or
after the PDU Session Establishment, or to remove from the data path of
a PDU Session a UPF supporting the Branching Point functionality after
the PDU Session Establishment.

Multi homing of a PDU Session applies only for PDU Sessions of IPv6
type. When the UE requests a PDU Session of type \"IPv4v6\" or \"IPv6\"
the UE also provides an indication to the network whether it supports a
Multi-homed IPv6 PDU Session.

The use of multiple IPv6 prefixes in a PDU Session is characterised by
the following:

\- The UPF supporting a Branching Point functionality is configured by
the SMF to spread UL traffic between the PDU Session Anchors based on
the Source Prefix of the PDU (which may be selected by the UE based on
routing information and preferences received from the network).

\- IETF RFC 4191 \[8\] is used to configure routing information and
preferences into the UE to influence the selection of the source Prefix.

NOTE 1: This corresponds to Scenario 1 defined in IETF RFC 7157 \[7\]
\"IPv6 Multi-homing without Network Address Translation\". This allows
to make the Branching Point unaware of the routing tables in the Data
Network and to keep the first hop router function in the PDU Session
Anchors.

\- The multi-homed PDU Session may be used to support make-before-break
service continuity to support SSC mode 3. This is illustrated in Figure
5.6.4.3-1.

\- The multi-homed PDU Session may also be used to support cases where
UE needs to access both a local service (e.g. local server) and a
central service (e.g. the internet), illustrated in Figure 5.6.4.3-2.

\- The UE shall use the method specified in clause 4.3.5.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] to determine if a multi-homed PDU Session is used to
support the service continuity case shown in Figure 5.6.4.3-1, or if it
is used to support the local access to DN case shown in
Figure 5.6.4.3-2.

Point and the PDU Session Anchor functionalities.

Point and the PDU Session Anchor functionalities.

### 5.6.5 Support for Local Area Data Network

The access to a DN via a PDU Session for a LADN is only available in a
specific LADN service area. A LADN service area is a set of Tracking
Areas. LADN is a service provided by the serving PLMN. It includes:

\- LADN service applies only to 3GPP accesses and does not apply in Home
Routed case.

\- The usage of LADN DNN requires an explicit subscription to this DNN
or subscription to a wildcard DNN.

\- Whether a DNN corresponds to a LADN service is an attribute of a DNN
and is per PLMN.

The UE is configured to know whether a DNN is a LADN DNN on a per-PLMN
basis, and an association between application and LADN DNN. The
configured association is considered to be a UE local configuration
defined in TS 23.503 \[45\]. Alternatively, the UE gets the information
whether a DNN is a LADN DNN from LADN Information during
(re‑)registration procedure as described in this clause.

NOTE 1: No other procedure for configuring the UE to know whether a DNN
is a LADN DNN is defined in this release of the specifications.

NOTE 2: The procedure for configuring the UE to know an association
between application and LADN DNN is not defined in this release of the
specifications.

LADN service area and LADN DNN are configured in the AMF on a per DN
basis, i.e. for different UEs accessing the same LADN, the configured
LADN service area is the same regardless of other factors (e.g. UE\'s
Registration Area or UE subscription).

NOTE 3: If a LADN is not available in any TA of an AMF\'s service area,
the AMF is not required to be configured with any LADN related
information for that DNN.

LADN Information (i.e. LADN Service Area Information and LADN DNN) is
provided by AMF to the UE during the Registration procedure or UE
Configuration Update procedure. For each LADN DNN configured in the AMF,
the corresponding LADN Service Area Information includes a set of
Tracking Areas that belong to the Registration Area that the AMF assigns
to the UE (i.e. the intersection of the LADN service area and the
assigned Registration Area). The AMF shall not create Registration Area
based on the availability of LADNs.

NOTE 4: It is thus possible that the LADN Service Area Information sent
by the AMF to the UE contains only a sub-set of the full LADN service
area as the LADN service area can contain TA(s) outside of the
registration area of the UE or outside of the area served by the AMF.

When the UE performs a successful (re-)registration procedure, the AMF
may provide to the UE, based on local configuration (e.g. via OAM) about
LADN, on UE location, and on UE subscription information received from
the UDM about subscribed DNN(s), the LADN Information for the list of
LADN available to the UE in that Registration Area in the Registration
Accept message.

The UE may provide either the LADN DNN(s) to retrieve the LADN
Information for the indicated LADN DNN(s) or an indication of Requesting
LADN Information to retrieve the LADN Information for all LADN(s)
available in the current Registration Area.

The list of LADN is determined as follows:

\- If neither LADN DNN nor an indication of requesting LADN Information
is provided in the Registration Request message, the list of LADN is the
LADN DNN(s) in subscribed DNN list except for wildcard DNN.

\- If the UE provides LADN DNN(s) in the Registration Request message,
the list of LADN is LADN DNN(s) the UE requested if the UE subscribed
DNN(s) includes the requested LADN DNN or if a wildcard DNN is included
in the UE\'s subscription data.

NOTE 5: It is assumed that an application can use only one LADN DNN at a
time.

\- If the UE provides an indication of requesting LADN Information in
the Registration Request message, the list of LADN is all the LADN
DNN(s) configured in the AMF if the wildcard DNN is subscribed, or the
LADN DNN(s) which is in subscribed DNN list and no wildcard DNN is
subscribed.

The UE considers the retrieved LADN Information valid only for the
registered PLMN and the E-PLMN(s) if the LADN Service Area Information
includes Tracking Areas that belong to E-PLMN(s). Additionally, an LADN
DNN discovered by the UE via the retrieved LADN Information is
considered an LADN DNN also in the E-PLMNs of the Registered PLMN, i.e.
the UE can request LADN Information for the discovered LADN DNN in the
E-PLMNs.

During the subsequent Registration procedure, if the network does not
provide LADN Information for a DNN, the UE deletes any LADN Information
for that DNN.

When the LADN Information for the UE in the 5GC is changed, the AMF
shall update LADN Information to the UE through UE Configuration
Update/Registration procedure as described in clauses 4.2.4 / 4.2.2.2.2
of TS 23.502 \[3\].

When receiving PDU Session Establishment with LADN DNN or Service
Request for the established PDU Session corresponding to LADN, the AMF
determines UE presence in LADN service area and forwards it to the SMF
if the requested DNN is configured at the AMF as a LADN DNN.

Based on the LADN Service Area Information in the UE, the UE determines
whether it is in or out of a LADN service area. If the UE does not have
the LADN Service Area Information for a LADN DNN, the UE shall consider
it is out of the LADN service area.

The UE takes actions as follows:

a\) When the UE is out of a LADN service area, the UE:

\- shall not request to activate UP connection of a PDU Session for this
LADN DNN;

\- shall not establish/modify a PDU Session for this LADN DNN (except
for PS Data Off status change reporting for an established PDU Session);

\- need not release any existing PDU Session for this LADN DNN unless UE
receives explicit SM PDU Session Release Request message from the
network.

b\) When the UE is in a LADN service area, the UE:

\- may request a PDU Session Establishment/Modification for this LADN
DNN;

\- may request to activate UP connection of the existing PDU Session for
this LADN DNN.

NOTE 6: The evaluation of Service Area Restrictions will be performed
before the evaluation of LADN service area, if the UE has overlapping
areas between Service Area Restrictions and LADN service area.

The SMF supporting a DNN is configured with information about whether
this DNN is a LADN DNN or not.

When receiving SM request corresponding an LADN from the AMF, the SMF
determines whether the UE is inside LADN service area based on the
indication (i.e. UE Presence in LADN service area) received from the
AMF. If the SMF does not receive the indication, the SMF considers that
the UE is outside of the LADN service area. The SMF shall reject the
request if the UE is outside of the LADN service area.

When the SMF receives a request for PDU Session Establishment with the
LADN DNN, it shall subscribe to \"UE mobility event notification\" for
reporting UE presence in Area of Interest by providing LADN DNN to the
AMF as described in clauses 5.6.11 and 5.3.4.4.

Based on the notification about the UE presence in LADN service area
notified by AMF (i.e. IN, OUT, or UNKNOWN), the SMF takes actions as
follows based on operator\'s policy:

a\) When SMF is informed that the UE presence in a LADN service area is
OUT, the SMF shall:

\- release the PDU Session immediately; or

\- deactivate the user plane connection for the PDU Session with
maintaining the PDU Session and ensure the Data Notification is disabled
and the SMF may release the PDU Session if the SMF is not informed that
the UE moves into the LADN service area after a period.

b\) When SMF is informed that the UE presence a LADN service area is IN,
the SMF shall:

\- ensure that Data Notification is enabled.

\- trigger the Network triggered Service Request procedure for a LADN
PDU Session to active the UP connection when the SMF receives downlink
data or Data Notification from UPF.

c\) When the SMF is informed that the UE presence in a LADN service area
is UNKNOWN, the SMF may:

\- ensure that Data Notification is enabled.

\- trigger the Network triggered Service Request procedure for a LADN
PDU Session to active the UP connection when the SMF receives downlink
data or Data Notification from UPF.

SMF may make use of UE mobility analytics provided by NWDAF, as
described in clause 6.7.2 of TS 23.288 \[86\], to determine UE presence
pattern in LADN service area and take a decision how to handle LADN PDN
Session (e.g. release the PDU Session immediately, or deactivate the
user plane connection for the PDU Session with maintaining the PDU
Session).

### 5.6.6 Secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA server during the establishment of a PDU Session

At PDU Session Establishment to a DN:

\- The DN-specific identity (TS 33.501 \[29\]) of a UE may be
authenticated/authorized by the DN.

NOTE 1: the DN-AAA server may belong to the 5GC or to the DN.

\- If the UE provides authentication/authorization information
corresponding to a DN-specific identity during the Establishment of the
PDU Session, and the SMF determines that Secondary
authentication/authorization of the PDU Session Establishment is
required based on the SMF policy associated with the DN, the SMF passes
the authentication/authorization information of the UE to the DN-AAA
server via the UPF if the DN-AAA server is located in the DN. If the SMF
determines that Secondary authentication/authorization of the PDU
Session Establishment is required but the UE has not provided a
DN-specific identity as part of the PDU Session Establishment request,
the SMF requests the UE to indicate a DN-specific identity using EAP
procedures as described in TS 33.501 \[29\]. If the Secondary
authentication/authorization of the PDU Session Establishment fails, the
SMF rejects the PDU Session Establishment.

NOTE 2: If the DN-AAA server is located in the 5GC and reachable
directly, then the SMF may communicate with it directly without
involving the UPF.

\- The DN-AAA server may authenticate/authorize the PDU Session
Establishment.

\- When DN-AAA server authorizes the PDU Session Establishment, it may
send DN Authorization Data for the established PDU Session to the SMF.
The DN authorization data for the established PDU Session may include
one or more of the following:

\- A DN Authorization Profile Index which is a reference to
authorization data for policy and charging control locally configured in
the SMF or PCF.

\- a list of allowed MAC addresses for the PDU Session; this shall apply
only for PDU Session of Ethernet PDU type and is further described in
clause 5.6.10.2.

\- a list of allowed VLAN tags for the PDU Session; this shall apply
only for PDU Session of Ethernet PDU type and is further described in
clause 5.6.10.2.

\- DN authorized Session AMBR for the PDU Session. The DN Authorized
Session AMBR for the PDU Session takes precedence over the subscribed
Session-AMBR received from the UDM.

\- Framed Route information (see clause 5.6.14) for the PDU Session.

\- L2TP information, such as LNS IP address and/or LNS host name, as
described in TS 29.561 \[132\].

SMF policies may require DN authorization without Secondary
authentication/authorization. In that case, when contacting the DN-AAA
server for authorization, the SMF provides the GPSI of the UE if
available.

Such Secondary authentication/authorization takes place for the purpose
of PDU Session authorization in addition to:

\- The 5GC access authentication handled by AMF and described in
clause 5.2.

\- The PDU Session authorization enforced by SMF with regards to
subscription data retrieved from UDM.

Based on local policies the SMF may initiate Secondary
authentication/authorization at PDU Session Establishment. The SMF
provides the GPSI, if available, in the signalling exchanged with the
DN-AAA during Secondary authentication/authorization.

After the successful Secondary authentication/authorization, a session
is kept between the SMF and the DN-AAA.

The UE provides the authentication/authorization information required to
support Secondary authentication/authorization by the DN over NAS SM.

If a UE is configured with DNNs, which are subject to secondary
authentication/authorization, the UE stores an association between the
DNN and corresponding credentials for the secondary
authentication/authorization.

NOTE 3: How the UE is aware that a DNN is subject to secondary
authentication/authorization (e.g., based on local configuration) is out
of scope of this specification.

The UE may support remote provisioning of credentials for secondary
authentication/authorization, as specified in clause 5.39.

A UE that supports to be provisioned with the credentials used for
secondary authentication/authorization over UP remote provisioning shall
use connectivity over an S-NSSAI/DNN which can access the provisioning
server to establish a PDU session for remote provisioning as defined in
clause 5.39.

NOTE 4: The credentials for secondary authentication/authorization are
not specified.

SMF policies or subscription information (such as defined in Table
5.2.3.3.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) may trigger the need for SMF to request
the Secondary authentication/authorization and/or UE IP address / Prefix
from the DN-AAA server.

When SMF adds a PDU Session Anchor (such as defined in clause 5.6.4) to
a PDU Session Secondary authentication/authorization is not carried out,
but SMF policies may require SMF to notify the DN when a new prefix or
address has been added to or removed from a PDU Session or N6 traffic
routing information has been changed for a PDU Session.

When SMF gets notified from UPF with the addition or removal of MAC
addresses to/from a PDU Session, the SMF policies may require SMF to
notify the DN-AAA server.

Indication of PDU Session Establishment rejection is transferred by SMF
to the UE via NAS SM.

If the DN-AAA sends DN Authorization Data for the authorized PDU Session
to the SMF and dynamic PCC is deployed, the SMF sends the PCF the DN
authorized Session AMBR and/or DN Authorization Profile Index in the DN
Authorization Data for the established PDU Session.

If the DN-AAA sends DN Authorization Profile Index in DN Authorization
Data to the SMF and dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF uses the DN
Authorization Profile Index to refer the locally configured information.

NOTE 5: DN Authorization Profile Index is assumed to be pre-negotiated
between the operator and the administrator of DN-AAA server.

If the DN-AAA does not send DN Authorization Data for the established
PDU Session, the SMF may use locally configured information.

At any time, a DN-AAA server may revoke the authorization for a PDU
Session or update DN Authorization Data for a PDU Session. According to
the request from DN-AAA server, the SMF may release or update the PDU
Session. See clause 5.6.14 when the update involves Framed Route
information.

At any time, a DN-AAA server or SMF may trigger Secondary
Re-authentication procedure for a PDU Session established with Secondary
Authentication as specified in clause 11.1.3 of TS 33.501 \[29\].

During Secondary Re-authentication/Re-authorization, if the SMF receives
from DN-AAA the DN authorized Session AMBR and/or DN Authorization
Profile Index, the SMF shall report the received value(s) to the PCF.

The procedure for secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA
server during the establishment of a PDU Session is described in
clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The support for L2TP on N6 is further specified in clause 5.8.2.16, and
the procedure for establishment of L2TP tunnelling on N6 for a PDU
Session is described in clause 4.3.2.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 6: The L2TP Tunnel information sent to the SMF can, for example, be
provisioned in the DN-AAA server per DNN/S-NSSAI or per SUPI or GPSI.

### 5.6.7 Application Function influence on traffic routing

#### 5.6.7.1 General

The content of this clause applies to non-roaming and to LBO deployments
i.e. to cases where the involved entities (AF, PCF, SMF, UPF) belong to
the Serving PLMN or AF belongs to a third party with which the Serving
PLMN has an agreement. AF influence on traffic routing does not apply in
the case of Home Routed deployments. PCF shall not apply AF requests to
influence traffic routing to PDU Sessions established in Home Routed
mode.

An AF may send requests to influence SMF routeing decisions for traffic
of PDU Session. The AF requests may influence UPF (re)selection and
(I-)SMF (re)selection and allow routeing user traffic to a local access
to a Data Network (identified by a DNAI).

The AF may issue requests on behalf of applications not owned by the
PLMN serving the UE.

If the operator does not allow an AF to access the network directly, the
AF shall use the NEF to interact with the 5GC, as described in
clause 6.2.10.

The AF may be in charge of the (re)selection or relocation of the
applications within the local part of the DN (as defined in
TS 23.548 \[130\]). Such functionality is not defined. For this purpose,
the AF may request to get notified about events related with PDU
Sessions.

In the case of AF instance change, the AF may send request of AF
relocation information.

The AF requests are sent to the PCF via N5 (in the case of requests
targeting specific on-going PDU Sessions of individual UE(s), for an AF
allowed to interact directly with the 5GC NFs) or via the NEF. The AF
requests that target existing or future PDU Sessions of multiple UE(s)
or of any UE are sent via the NEF and may target multiple PCF(s), as
described in clause 6.3.7.2. The PCF(s) transform(s) the AF requests
into policies that apply to PDU Sessions. When the AF has subscribed to
UP path management event notifications from SMF(s) (including
notifications on how to reach a GPSI over N6), such notifications are
sent either directly to the AF or via an NEF (without involving the
PCF). For AF interacting with PCF directly or via NEF, the AF requests
may contain the information as described in the Table 5.6.7-1:

Table 5.6.7-1: Information element contained in AF request

+----------------+-------------------+--------------------+-----------+

For each information element mentioned above in the AF request, the
detailed description is as follows:

1\) Information to identify the traffic. The traffic can be identified
in the AF request by

\- Either a DNN and possibly slicing information (S-NSSAI) or an
AF-Service-Identifier

\- When the AF provides an AF-Service-Identifier i.e. an identifier of
the service on behalf of which the AF is issuing the request, the 5G
Core maps this identifier into a target DNN and slicing information
(S-NSSAI)

\- When the NEF processes the AF request the AF-Service-Identifier may
be used to authorize the AF request.

\- An application identifier or traffic filtering information (e.g. 5
Tuple or FQDN range). The application identifier refers to an
application handling UP traffic and is used by the UPF to detect the
traffic of the application

When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the
information is to identify the traffic to be routed.

When FQDN range is provided it may be used by SMF as one of the triggers
for retrieving EAS Deployment Information from NEF. Retrieval of EAS
Deployment Information is defined in TS 23.548 \[130\].

NOTE 1: It is also possible that the SMF triggers retrieving EAS
Deployment Information based on implementation or local configuration.

When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the information is to identify the traffic that the
events relate to.

2\) Information about the N6 traffic routing requirements for traffic
identified as defined in 1). This includes:

\- Information about the N6 traffic routing requirements that is
provided per DNAI: for each DNAI, the N6 traffic routing requirements
may contain a routing profile ID and/or N6 traffic routing information.

\- An optional indication of traffic correlation, when the information
in 4) identifies a group of UEs. This implies the targeted PDU Sessions
should be correlated by a common DNAI in the user plane for the traffic
identified in 1). If this indication is provided by the AF, the 5GC
should select a common DNAI for the target PDU Sessions from the list of
DNAI(s) specified in 3).

NOTE 2: The N6 traffic routing requirements are related to the mechanism
enabling traffic steering in the local access to the DN. The routing
profile ID refers to a pre-agreed policy between the AF and the 5GC.
This policy may refer to different steering policy ID(s) sent to SMF and
e.g. based on time of the day etc.

NOTE 3: The mechanisms enabling traffic steering in the local access to
the DN are not defined.

3\) Potential locations of applications towards which the traffic
routing should apply. The potential location of application is expressed
as a list of DNAI(s). If the AF interacts with the PCF via the NEF, the
NEF may map the AF-Service-Identifier information to a list of DNAI(s).
The DNAI(s) may be used for UPF (re)selection and (I‑)SMF (re)selection.

4\) Information on the UE(s). This may correspond to:

\- Individual UEs identified using GPSI, or an IP address/Prefix or a
MAC address.

\- Groups of UEs identified by an External Group Identifier as defined
in TS 23.682 \[36\] when the AF interacts via the NEF, or Internal-Group
Identifier (see clause 5.9.7) when the AF interacts directly with the
PCF.

\- Any UE accessing the combination of DNN, S-NSSAI and DNAI(s).

When the PDU Session type is IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6, and the AF provides
an IP address and/or an IP Prefix, or when the PDU Session type is
Ethernet and the AF provides a MAC address, this allows the PCF to
identify the PDU Session for which this request applies and the AF
request applies only to that specific PDU Session of the UE. In this
case, additional information such as the UE identity may also be
provided to help the PCF to identify the correct PDU Session.

Otherwise the request targets multiple UE(s) and shall apply to any
existing or future PDU Sessions that match the parameters in the AF
request.

When the AF request targets an individual UE and GPSI is provided within
the AF request, the GPSI is mapped to SUPI according to the subscription
information received from UDM.

When the AF request targets any UE or a group of UE, the AF request is
likely to influence multiple PDU Sessions possibly served by multiple
SMFs and PCFs.

When the AF request targets a group of UE it provides one or several
group identifiers in its request. The group identifiers provided by the
AF are mapped to Internal-Group identifiers. Members of the group have
this Group Identifier in their subscription. The Internal-Group
Identifier is stored in UDM, retrieved by SMF from UDM and passed by SMF
to PCF at PDU Session set-up. The PCF can then map the AF requests with
user subscription and determine whether an AF request targeting a Group
of users applies to a PDU Session.

When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the
information is to identify UE(s) whose traffic is to be routed.

When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the information is to identify UE(s) whose traffic
the events relate to.

When the AF request is for traffic forwarding in a PDU Session serving
for TSC, the MAC address used by the PDU Session is determined by the AF
to identify UE whose traffic is to be routed according to the previously
stored binding relationship of the 5GS Bridge and the port number of the
traffic forwarding information received from TSN network.

5\) Indication of application relocation possibility. This indicates
whether an application can be relocated once a location of the
application is selected by the 5GC. If application relocation is not
possible, the 5GC shall ensure that for the traffic related with an
application, no DNAI change takes place once selected for this
application.

6\) Temporal validity condition. This is provided in the form of time
interval(s) or duration(s) during which the AF request is to be applied.

When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the
temporal validity condition indicates when the traffic routing is to
apply.

When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the temporal validity condition indicates when the
notifications are to be generated.

7\) Spatial validity condition on the UE(s) location. This is provided
in the form of validity area(s). If the AF interacts with the PCF via
the NEF, it may provide geographical area (e.g. a civic address or
shapes) and the NEF maps the information to areas of validity based on
pre-configuration. The PCF in turn determines area(s) of interest based
on validity area(s).

When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the
spatial validity condition indicates that the request applies only to
the traffic of UE(s) located in the specified location.

When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the spatial validity condition indicates that the
subscription applies only to the traffic of UE(s) located in the
specified location.

8\) Information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events.

The AF may request to be subscribed to change of UP path associated with
traffic identified in the bullet 1) above. The AF request contains:

\- A type of subscription (subscription for Early and/or Late
notifications).

The AF subscription can be for Early notifications and/or Late
notifications. In the case of a subscription for Early notifications,
the SMF sends the notifications before the (new) UP path is configured.
In the case of a subscription for Late notifications, the SMF sends the
notification after the (new) UP path has been configured.

\- Notification target address for receiving event notification.

\- Optionally, an indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\".

The indication implies that the AF will provide a response to the
notifications of UP path management events to the 5GC. The SMF may,
according to this indication, determine to wait for a response from the
AF before the SMF configures in the case of early notification, or
activates in the case of late notification, the new UP path as described
in clause 5.6.7.2.

The AF subscription can also request to receive information associating
the GPSI of the UE with the IP address(es) of the UE and/or with actual
N6 traffic routing to be used to reach the UE on the PDU Session; in
this case the corresponding information is sent by the SMF regardless of
whether a DNAI applies to the PDU Session.

9\) An AF transaction identifier referring to the AF request. This
allows the AF to update or remove the AF request and to identify
corresponding UP path management event notifications. The AF transaction
identifier is generated by the AF.

When the AF interacts with the PCF via the NEF, the NEF maps the AF
transaction identifier to an AF transaction internal identifier, which
is generated by the NEF and used within the 5GC to identify the
information associated to the AF request. The NEF maintains the mapping
between the AF transaction identifier and the AF transaction internal
identifier. The relation between the two identifiers is implementation
specific.

When the AF interacts with the PCF directly, the AF transaction
identifier provided by the AF is used as AF transaction internal
identifier within the 5GC.

10\) Indication of UE IP address preservation. This indicates UE IP
address related to the traffic identified in bullet 1) should be
preserved. If this indication is provided by the AF, the 5GC should
preserve the UE IP address by preventing reselection of PSA UPF for the
identified traffic once the PSA UPF is selected.

11\) Information for EAS IP Replacement in 5GC. This indicates the
Source EAS identifier and Target EAS identifier (i.e. IP addresses and
port numbers of the source and target EAS) for a service subject to Edge
Computing.

12\) User Plane Latency Requirement. This includes AF requirements for
User Plane latency. (see clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.548 \[130\]).

13\) Information on AF change. The AF relocation information includes:

\- AF Identifier: the identifier of the target AF instance.

NOTE 4: The AF relocation information is applicable for interaction with
NEF only and it is not stored in UDR or transferred to PCF, even for the
case AF directly interacts with PCF.

14\) Indication for EAS relocation. This indicates the application(s)
are to be relocated.

15\) Indication for Simultaneous Connectivity over source and target PSA
at Edge Relocation (see clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.548 \[130\]). Indicates
that source and target PSA should coexist for some time at PSA
relocation, and may influence the establishment of a temporary N9
forwarding tunnel between the source UL CL and target UL CL. It may also
provide guidance for the time interval after the described traffic
ceases when the connectivity over the source PSA may be removed.

An AF may send requests to influence SMF routeing decisions, for event
subscription or for both.

The AF may request to be subscribed to notifications about UP path
management events, i.e. a UP path change occurs for the PDU Session. The
corresponding notification about a UP path change sent by the SMF to the
AF may indicate the DNAI and /or the N6 traffic routing information that
has changed as described in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. It may
include the AF transaction internal identifier, the type of notification
(i.e. early notification or late notification), the Identity of the
source and/or target DNAI, the IP address/prefix of the UE or the MAC
address used by the UE, the GPSI and the N6 traffic routing information
related to the 5GC UP.

NOTE 5: The change from the UP path status where no DNAI applies to a
status where a DNAI applies indicates the activation of this AF request;
the change from the UP path status where a DNAI applies to a status
where no DNAI applies indicates the de-activation of this AF request.

In the case of IP PDU Session Type, the IP address/prefix of the UE
together with N6 traffic routing information indicates to the AF how to
reach over the User Plane the UE identified by its GPSI. N6 traffic
routing information indicates any tunnelling that may be used over N6.
The nature of this information depends on the deployment.

NOTE 6: N6 traffic routing information can e.g. correspond to the
identifier of a VPN or to explicit tunnelling information such as a
tunnelling protocol identifier together with a Tunnel identifier.

NOTE 7: In the case of Unstructured PDU Session type the nature of the
N6 traffic routing information related to the 5GC UP is described in
clause 5.6.10.3.

In the case of Ethernet PDU Session Type, the MAC address of the UE
together with N6 traffic routing information indicates to the AF how to
reach over the User Plane the UE identified by its GPSI. The UE MAC
address (es) is reported by the UPF as described in clause 5.8.2.12. The
N6 traffic routing information can be, e.g. a VLAN ID or the identifier
of a VPN or a tunnel identifier at the UPF.

When notifications about UP path management events are sent to the AF
via the NEF, if required, the NEF maps the UE identify information, e.g.
SUPI, to the GPSI and the AF transaction internal identifier to the AF
transaction identifier before sending the notifications to the AF.

The PCF, based on information received from the AF, operator\'s policy,
optionally service experience analytics per UP path received from NWDAF,
etc., authorizes the request received from the AF and determines for
each DNAI, a traffic steering policy ID (derived from the routing
profile ID provided by the AF) and/or the N6 traffic routing information
(as provided by the AF) to be sent to the SMF as part of the PCC rules.
The traffic steering policy IDs are configured in the SMF or in the UPF.
The traffic steering policy IDs are related to the mechanism enabling
traffic steering to the DN.

The DNAIs are related to the information considered by the SMF for UPF
selection and (I‑)SMF (re)selection, e.g. for diverting (locally) some
traffic matching traffic filters provided by the PCF.

The PCF acknowledges a request targeting an individual PDU Session to
the AF or to the NEF.

For PDU Session that corresponds to the AF request, the PCF provides the
SMF with a PCC rule that is generated based on the AF request, Local
routing indication from the PDU Session policy control subscription
information and taking into account UE location presence in area of
interest (i.e. Presence Reporting Area). The PCC rule contains the
information to identify the traffic, information about the DNAI(s)
towards which the traffic routing should apply and optionally, an
indication of traffic correlation and/or an indication of application
relocation possibility and/or indication of UE IP address preservation.
The PCC rule also contains per DNAI a traffic steering policy ID and/or
N6 traffic routing information, if the N6 traffic routing information is
explicitly provided in the AF request. The PCF may also provide in the
PCC rule information to subscribe the AF (or the NEF) to SMF events (UP
path changes) corresponding to the AF request in which case it provides
the information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events received
in the AF request. This is done by providing policies at PDU Session
set-up or by initiating a PDU Session Modification procedure. When
initiating a PDU Session set-up or PDU Session Modification procedure,
the PCF considers the latest known UE location to determine the PCC
rules provided to the SMF. The PCF evaluates the temporal validity
condition of the AF request and informs the SMF to activate or
deactivate the corresponding PCC rules according to the evaluation
result. When policies specific to the PDU Session and policies general
to multiple PDU Sessions exist, the PCF gives precedence to the PDU
Session specific policies over the general policies. The PCF authorizes
the AF request of User Plane Latency Requirements. If the PCF determines
that the requirements can\'t be authorized, the PCF rejects the AF
request.

The spatial validity condition is resolved at the PCF. In order to do
that, the PCF subscribes to the SMF to receive notifications about
change of UE location in an area of interest (i.e. Presence Reporting
Area). The subscribed area of interest may be the same as spatial
validity condition, or may be a subset of the spatial validity condition
(e.g. a list of TAs) based on the latest known UE location. When the SMF
detects that UE entered the area of interest subscribed by the PCF, the
SMF notifies the PCF and the PCF provides to the SMF the PCC rules
described above by triggering a PDU Session Modification. When the SMF
becomes aware that the UE left the area subscribed by the PCF, the SMF
notifies the PCF and the PCF provides updated PCC rules by triggering a
PDU Session Modification. SMF notifications to the PCF about UE location
in or out of the subscribed area of interest are triggered by UE
location change notifications received from the AMF or by UE location
information received during a Service Request or Handover procedure.

When the PCC rules are activated, the SMF may, based on local policies,
take the information in the PCC rules and, optionally, the Service
Experience analytics and/or DN Performance analytics per UP path
(including UPF and/or DNAI and/or AS instance) as defined in
clause 6.4.3 and clause 6.14.3, respectively, of TS 23.288 \[86\] into
account to:

\- (re)select UP paths (including DNAI(s)) for PDU Sessions. The SMF is
responsible for handling the mapping between the UE location (TAI /
Cell-Id) and DNAI(s) associated with UPF and applications and the
selection of the UPF(s) that serve a PDU Session. This is described in
clause 6.3.3. If the PDU Session is of IP type and if Indication of UE
IP address preservation is included in the PCC rules, the SMF should
preserve the UE IP address, by not reselecting the related PSA UPF once
the PSA UPF is selected, for the traffic identified in the PCC rule. If
the user plane latency requirement is included in the PCC rules, the SMF
chooses the PSA UPF that satisfies the user plane latency requirement.
If the PCC rules are related to a 5G VN group served by the SMF and if
the Information about the N6 traffic routing requirements includes an
indication of traffic correlation, the SMF should select a common DNAI
for the PDU Sessions of the 5G VN group.

\- configure traffic steering at UPF, including activating mechanisms
for traffic multi-homing or enforcement of an UL Classifier (UL CL).
Such mechanisms are defined in clause 5.6.4. This may include that the
SMF is providing the UPF with packet handling instructions (i.e. PDRs
and FARs) for steering traffic to the local access to the DN. The packet
handling instructions are generated by the SMF using the traffic
steering policy ID and/or the N6 traffic routing information in the PCC
rules corresponding to the applied DNAI. In the case of UP path
reselection, the SMF may configure the source UPF to forward traffic to
the UL CL/BP so that the traffic is steered towards the target UPF.

\- if Information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events has
been provided in the PCC rule, inform the AF of the (re)selection of the
UP path (UP path change). If the information includes an indication of
\"AF acknowledgment to be expected\", the SMF may decide to wait for a
response from the AF before it activates the new UP path, as described
in clause 5.6.7.2.

When an I-SMF is inserted for a PDU Session, the I-SMF insertion,
relocation or removal to a PDU session shall be transparent (i.e. not
aware) to the PCF and to the AF. The processing of the AF influence on
traffic routing is described in clause 5.34 and detail procedure is
described in clause 4.23.6 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 5.6.7.2 Enhancement of UP path management based on the coordination with AFs

In order to avoid or minimize service interruption during PSA relocation
for a PDU session of SSC mode 3, or a PDU session with UL CL or branch
point, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events (DNAI change)
in the PCC rules received from the PCF and local configuration (e.g.
DN-related policies) the SMF may wait for a response from the AF after
sending a notification (an early notification or a late notification) to
the AF. In the case of late notification, based on the indication of
\"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" on AF subscription, the SMF may
send the notification before activating the UP path towards a new DNAI
(possibly through a new PSA).

NOTE 1: Before the UP path toward the new DNAI is activated, application
traffic data (if any exists) is still routed toward the old DNAI.

The notification sent from the SMF to the AF indicates UP path
management events (DNAI change) as described in clause 5.6.7.1. The AF
can confirm the DNAI change indicated in the notification with the SMF
by sending a positive response to the notification to the SMF or reject
the DNAI change by sending a negative response.

NOTE 2: The AF can determine whether application relocation is needed
according to the notification of DNAI change. If not, the AF can send a
positive response to the SMF immediately; otherwise, the AF sends the
positive response after application relocation is completed or a
negative response if the AF determines that the application relocation
cannot be completed on time (e.g. due to temporary congestion). The AF
decision and behaviours on application relocation are not defined.
However, the new DNAI may be associated with a new AF. In such cases,
the SMF and the old AF cancel earlier subscribed UP path management
event notifications, and the new AF subscribes to receive UP path
management event notifications from the SMF.

The AF can include N6 traffic routing information related to the target
DNAI in a positive response sent to the SMF. The SMF configures the N6
traffic routing information from the AF response to the PSA on the UP
path.

The AF can include the EAS relocation Indication to indicate the
application(s) to be relocated.

In the case of early notification, based on the indication of \"AF
acknowledgment to be expected\" on AF subscription, the SMF does not
configure the UP path towards the new DNAI until it receives a positive
AF response as specified in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

In the case of late notification, based on the indication of \"AF
acknowledgment to be expected\" on AF subscription, the SMF does not
activate the UP path towards the new DNAI until it receives a positive
AF response as specified in clause 4.3.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 3: After the UP path toward the new DNAI is activated, data is
routed toward the new DNAI.

If the SMF receives a negative response at any time, the SMF keeps using
the original DNAI and may cancel related PSA relocation or addition. The
SMF may perform DNAI reselection afterwards if needed.

The SMF can assume according to local policy a negative response if a
response is expected and but not received from the AF within a certain
time window.

When Early/Late Notification happens, the SMF notifies AF about the
target DNAI and may indicate capability of supporting EAS IP replacement
in 5GC.When EAS relocation is performed, the AF sends an/a early/late
notification response to the SMF after the EAS relocation is completed,
which may include the Information for EAS IP Replacement in 5GC. The SMF
may instruct the local PSA with the EAS IP address replacement using
\"Outer Header Creation\" as defined in clause 5.8.2.11.6 and \"Outer
Header Removal\" as defined in clause 5.8.2.11.3. If local PSA
relocation is required, the SMF may request the target local PSA to
buffer uplink traffic as described in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.548 \[130\].

### 5.6.8 Selective activation and deactivation of UP connection of existing PDU Session

This clause applies to the case when a UE has established multiple PDU
Sessions. The activation of a UP connection of an existing PDU Session
causes the activation of its UE-CN User Plane connection (i.e. data
radio bearer and N3 tunnel).

For the UE in the CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access, either UE or
Network-Triggered Service Request procedure may support independent
activation of UP connection of existing PDU Session. For the UE in the
CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access, UE-Triggered Service Request procedure
allows the re-activation of UP connection of existing PDU Sessions, and
may support independent activation of UP connection of existing PDU
Session.

A UE in the CM-CONNECTED state invokes a Service Request (see
clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) procedure to request the independent
activation of the UP connection of existing PDU Sessions.

Network Triggered re-activation of UP connection of existing PDU
Sessions is handled as follows:

\- If the UE CM state in the AMF is already CM-CONNECTED on the access
(3GPP, non-3GPP) associated to the PDU Session in the SMF, the network
may re-activate the UP connection of a PDU Session using a Network
Initiated Service Request procedure.

Otherwise:

\- If the UE is registered in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and the UE
CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE in non-3GPP access, the UE can be paged
or notified through the 3GPP access for a PDU Session associated in the
SMF (i.e. last routed) to the non-3GPP access:

\- If the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE in 3GPP access, the paging
message may include the access type associated with the PDU Session in
the SMF. The UE, upon reception of the paging message containing an
access type, shall reply to the 5GC via the 3GPP access using the NAS
Service Request message, which shall contain the list of PDU Sessions
associated with the received access type and whose UP connections can be
re-activated over 3GPP (i.e. the list does not contain the PDU Sessions
whose UP connections cannot be re-activated on 3GPP based on UE policies
and whether the S-NSSAIs of these PDU Sessions are within the Allowed
NSSAI for 3GPP access). If the PDU Session for which the UE has been
paged is in the list of the PDU Sessions provided in the NAS Service
Request and the paging was triggered by pending DL data, the 5GC shall
re-activate the PDU Session UP connection over 3GPP access. If the
paging was triggered by pending DL signalling, the Service Request
succeeds without re-activating the PDU session UP connection over the
3GPP access and the pending DL signalling is delivered to the UE over
the 3GPP access;

\- If the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP access, the
notification message shall include the non-3GPP Access Type. The UE,
upon reception of the notification message, shall reply to the 5GC via
the 3GPP access using the NAS Service Request message, which shall
contain the List of Allowed PDU Sessions that can be re-activated over
3GPP or an empty List of Allowed PDU Sessions if no PDU Sessions are
allowed to be re-activated over 3GPP access.

NOTE: A UE that is in a coverage of a non-3GPP access and has PDU
Session(s) that are associated in the UE (i.e. last routed) to non-3GPP
access, is assumed to attempt to connect to it without the need to be
paged.

\- If the UE is registered in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses served by
the same AMF and the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE in 3GPP access
and is in CM-CONNECTED in non 3GPP access, the UE can be notified
through the non-3GPP for a PDU Session associated in the SMF (i.e. last
routed) to the 3GPP access. The notification message shall include the
3GPP Access Type. Upon reception of the notification message, when 3GPP
access is available, the UE shall reply to the 5GC via the 3GPP access
using the NAS Service Request message.

In addition to the above, a PDU Session may be established as an
always-on PDU Session as described in clause 5.6.13.

The deactivation of the UP connection of an existing PDU Session causes
the corresponding data radio bearer and N3 tunnel to be deactivated. The
UP connection of different PDU Sessions can be deactivated independently
when a UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in 3GPP access or non-3GPP access. At
the deactivation of the UP of a PDU Session using a N9 tunnel whose
end-point is controlled by an I-SMF, the N9 tunnel is preserved. If a
PDU Session is an always-on PDU Session, the SMF should not deactivate a
UP connection of this PDU Session due to inactivity.

### 5.6.9 Session and Service Continuity

#### 5.6.9.1 General

The support for session and service continuity in 5G System architecture
enables to address the various continuity requirements of different
applications/services for the UE. The 5G System supports different
session and service continuity (SSC) modes defined in this clause. The
SSC mode associated with a PDU Session does not change during the
lifetime of a PDU Session. The following three modes are specified with
further details provided in the next clause:

\- With SSC mode 1, the network preserves the connectivity service
provided to the UE. For the case of PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or
IPv4v6 type, the IP address is preserved.

\- With SSC mode 2, the network may release the connectivity service
delivered to the UE and release the corresponding PDU Session(s). For
the case of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, the release of the PDU Session
induces the release of IP address(es) that had been allocated to the UE.

\- With SSC mode 3, changes to the user plane can be visible to the UE,
while the network ensures that the UE suffers no loss of connectivity. A
connection through new PDU Session Anchor point is established before
the previous connection is terminated in order to allow for better
service continuity. For the case of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, the IP
address is not preserved in this mode when the PDU Session Anchor
changes.

NOTE: In this Release of the specification, the addition/removal
procedure of additional PDU Session Anchor in a PDU Session for local
access to a DN is independent from the SSC mode of the PDU Session.

#### 5.6.9.2 SSC mode

##### 5.6.9.2.1 SSC Mode 1

For a PDU Session of SSC mode 1, the UPF acting as PDU Session Anchor at
the establishment of the PDU Session is maintained regardless of the
access technology (e.g. Access Type and cells) a UE is successively
using to access the network.

In the case of a PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, IP
continuity is supported regardless of UE mobility events.

In this Release of the specification, when IPv6 multihoming or UL CL
applies to a PDU Session of in SSC mode 1, and the network allocates
(based on local policies) additional PDU Session Anchors to such a PDU
Session, these additional PDU Session Anchors may be released or
allocated, and the UE does not expect that the additional IPv6 prefix is
maintained during the lifetime of PDU Session.

SSC mode 1 may apply to any PDU Session type and to any access type.

A UE supporting PDU Connectivity shall support SSC mode 1.

##### 5.6.9.2.2 SSC Mode 2

If a PDU Session of SSC mode 2 has a single PDU Session Anchor, the
network may trigger the release of the PDU Session and instruct the UE
to establish a new PDU Session to the same data network immediately. The
trigger condition depends on operator policy e.g. request from
Application Function, based on load status, etc. At establishment of the
new PDU Session, a new UPF acting as PDU Session Anchor can be selected.

Otherwise, if a PDU Session of SSC mode 2 has multiple PDU Session
Anchors (i.e. in the case of multi-homed PDU Sessions or in the case
that UL CL applies to a PDU Session of SSC mode 2), the additional PDU
Session Anchors may be released or allocated.

SSC mode 2 may apply to any PDU Session type and to any access type.

SSC mode 2 is optional to be supported in the UE.

NOTE 1: Features depending on SSC mode 2 will not work with the lack of
support for SSC mode 2 in the UE.

NOTE 2: In UL CL mode, the UE is not involved in PDU Session Anchor
re-allocation, so that the existence of multiple PDU Session Anchors is
not visible to the UE.

##### 5.6.9.2.3 SSC Mode 3

For PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the network allows the establishment of
UE connectivity via a new PDU Session Anchor to the same data network
before connectivity between the UE and the previous PDU Session Anchor
is released. When trigger conditions apply, the network decides whether
to select a PDU Session Anchor UPF suitable for the UE\'s new conditions
(e.g. point of attachment to the network).

In this Release of specification, SSC mode 3 only applies to IP PDU
Session type and to any access type.

In the case of a PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, during the
procedure of change of PDU Session Anchor, the following applies:

a\. For a PDU Session of IPv6 type, the new IP prefix anchored on the
new PDU Session Anchor may be allocated within the same PDU Session
(relying on IPv6 multi-homing specified in clause 5.6.4.3), or

b\. The new IP address and/or IP prefix may be allocated within a new
PDU Session that the UE is triggered to establish.

After the new IP address/prefix has been allocated, the old IP
address/prefix is maintained during some time indicated to the UE via
NAS signalling (as described in clause 4.3.5.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) or
via Router Advertisement (as described in clause 4.3.5.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]) and then released.

If a PDU Session of SSC mode 3 has multiple PDU Session Anchors (i.e. in
the case of multi-homed PDU Sessions or in the case that UL CL applies
to a PDU Session of SSC mode 3), the additional PDU Session Anchors may
be released or allocated.

SSC mode 3 is optional to be supported in the UE.

NOTE: Features depending on SSC mode 3 will not work with the lack of
support for SSC mode 3 in the UE.

#### 5.6.9.3 SSC mode selection

SSC mode selection is done by the SMF based on the allowed SSC modes
-including the default SSC mode) in the user subscription as well as the
PDU Session type and if present, the SSC mode requested by the UE.

The operator may provision a SSC mode selection policy (SSCMSP) to the
UE as part of the URSP rule -see clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503 \[45\]). The
UE shall use the SSCMSP to determine the type of session and service
continuity mode associated with an application or group of applications
for the UE as described in clause 6.6.2.3 of TS 23.503 \[45\]. If the UE
does not have SSCMSP, the UE can select a SSC mode based on UE Local
Configuration as described in TS 23.503 \[45\], if applicable. If the UE
cannot select a SSC mode, the UE requests the PDU Session without
providing the SSC mode.

NOTE 1: The UE can use the SSC Mode Selection component of the URSP rule
with match-all traffic descriptor if there is no SSC mode in the UE
local configuration.

The SSC mode selection policy rules provided to the UE can be updated by
the operator by updating the URSP rule.

The SMF receives from the UDM the list of allowed SSC modes and the
default SSC mode per DNN per S-NSSAI as part of the subscription
information.

If a UE provides an SSC mode when requesting a new PDU Session, the SMF
selects the SSC mode by either accepting the requested SSC mode or
rejecting the PDU Session Establishment Request message with the cause
value and the SSC mode(s) allowed to be used back to UE based on the PDU
Session type, subscription and/or local configuration. Based on that
cause value and the SSC mode(s) allowed to be used, the UE may
re-attempt to request the establishment of that PDU Session with the SSC
mode allowed to be used or using another URSP rule.

If a UE does not provide an SSC mode when requesting a new PDU Session,
then the SMF selects the default SSC mode for the data network listed in
the subscription or applies local configuration to select the SSC mode.

SSC mode 1 shall be assigned to the PDU Session when static IP
address/prefix is allocated to the PDU Session based on the static IP
address/prefix subscription for the DNN and S-NSSAI. The SMF shall
inform the UE of the selected SSC mode for a PDU Session.

The UE shall not request and the network shall not assign SSC mode 3 for
the PDU Session of Unstructured type or Ethernet type.

NOTE 2: To avoid issues for UEs not supporting all SSC modes, the
operator can, in the subscription data and local configuration, include
at least SSC mode 1 in the allowed SSC modes, and set default SSC mode
to 1 (since all UEs supporting PDU sessions are mandated to support SSC
mode 1). Still the 5GC can trigger PDU session release with a cause code
indicating reactivation due to, e.g. restoration or user plane path
optimization purposes, though this may cause interruption of the
service.

### 5.6.10 Specific aspects of different PDU Session types

#### 5.6.10.1 Support of IP PDU Session type

The IP address allocation is defined in clause 5.8.1

The UE may acquire following configuration information from the SMF,
during the lifetime of a PDU Session:

\- Address(es) of P-CSCF(s);

\- Address(es) of DNS server(s).

\- If the UE indicates support of DNS over (D) TLS to the network and
the network wants to enforce the use of DNS over (D)TLS, the
configuration information is sent by the SMF via PCO may also include
the corresponding DNS server security information as specified in
TS 24.501 \[47\] and TS 33.501 \[29\].

\- the GPSI of the UE.

The UE may acquire from the SMF, at PDU Session Establishment, the MTU
that the UE shall consider, see clause 5.6.10.4.

The UE may provide following information to the SMF during the lifetime
of a PDU Session:

\- an indication of the support of P-CSCF re-selection based on
procedures specified in TS 24.229 \[62\] (clauses B.2.2.1C and
L.2.2.1C).

\- PS data off status of the UE.

NOTE 2: An operator can deploy NAT functionality in the network; the
support of NAT is not specified in this release of the specification.

#### 5.6.10.2 Support of Ethernet PDU Session type

For a PDU Session set up with the Ethernet PDU Session type, the SMF and
the UPF acting as PDU Session Anchor (PSA) can support specific
behaviours related with the fact the PDU Session carries Ethernet
frames.

Depending on operator configuration related with the DNN, different
configurations for how Ethernet traffic is handled on N6 may apply, for
example:

\- Configurations with a 1-1 relationship between a PDU Session and a N6
interface possibly corresponding to a dedicated tunnel established over
N6. In this case the UPF acting as PSA transparently forwards Ethernet
frames between the PDU Session and its corresponding N6 interface, and
it does not need to be aware of MAC addresses used by the UE in order to
route down-link traffic.

\- Configurations, where more than one PDU Session to the same DNN (e.g.
for more than one UE) corresponds to the same N6 interface. In this case
the UPF acting as PSA needs to be aware of MAC addresses used by the UE
in the PDU Session in order to map down-link Ethernet frames received
over N6 to the appropriate PDU Session. Forwarding behaviour of the UPF
acting as PSA is managed by SMF as specified in clause 5.8.2.5.

NOTE 1: The \"MAC addresses used by the UE\" correspond to any MAC
address used by the UE or any device locally connected to the UE and
using the PDU Session to communicate with the DN.

Based on operator configuration, the SMF may request the UPF acting as
the PDU Session Anchor to respond to ARP/IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation
requests based on local cache information, i.e. the mapping between the
UE MAC address to the UE IP address, and the DN where the PDU Session is
connected to, or to redirect the ARP traffic from the UPF to the SMF.
Responding to ARP/IPv6 ND based on local cache information applies to
ARP/IPv6 ND received in both UL and DL directions.

NOTE 2: Responding to ARP/ND from a local cache assumes the UE or the
devices behind the UE acquire their IP address via in-band mechanisms
that the SMF/UPF can detect and by this link the IP address to the MAC
address.

NOTE 3: This mechanism is intended to avoid broadcasting or multicasting
the ARP/IPv6 ND to every UE.

Ethernet Preamble and Start of Frame delimiter are not sent over 5GS:

\- For UL traffic the UE strips the preamble and frame check sequence
(FCS) from the Ethernet frame.

\- For DL traffic the PDU Session Anchor strips the preamble and frame
check sequence (FCS) from the Ethernet frame.

Neither a MAC nor an IP address is allocated by the 5GC to the UE for a
PDU Session.

The PSA shall store the MAC addresses received from the UE, and
associate those with the appropriate PDU Session.

The SMF may receive a list of allowed VLAN tags from DN-AAA (for a
maximum of 16 VLAN tags) or may be locally configured with allowed VLAN
tags values. The SMF may also be configured with instructions on VLAN
handling (e.g. the VLAN tag to be inserted or removed, S-TAG to be
inserted or removed). Taking this into account, the SMF determines the
VLAN handling for the PDU Session, and instructs the UPF to accept or
discard the UE traffic based on the allowed VLAN tags, as well as to
handle VLAN tags (addition/removal) via PDR (Outer header removal) and
FAR (UPF applying Outer header creation of a Forwarding policy). For
example:

\- The UPF may insert (for uplink traffic) and remove (for downlink
traffic) a S-TAG on N6 or N19 or internal interface (\"5G VN internal\")
for the traffic from and to the UE.

\- The UPF may insert (for uplink traffic) and remove (for downlink
traffic) a VLAN tag on the N6 interface while there is no VLAN in the
traffic to and from the UE.

\- The UPF may discard any UE traffic that does not contain any allowed
VLAN tag when the UPF handles the UE uplink or downlink traffic.

NOTE 4: This can be used for traffic steering to N6-LAN but also for
N6-based traffic forwarding related with 5G-VN service described in
clause 5.29.4

Apart from specific conditions related to the support of PDU sessions
over W-5GAN defined in TS 23.316 \[84\], the UPF shall not remove VLAN
tags sent by the UE and the UPF shall not insert VLAN tags for the
traffic sent to the UE.

PDU(s) containing a VLAN tag shall be switched only within the same VLAN
by a PDU Session Anchor.

The UE may acquire from the SMF, at PDU Session Establishment, the MTU
of the Ethernet frames\' payload that the UE shall consider, see
clause 5.6.10.4.

NOTE 5: The UE may operate in bridge mode with regard to a LAN it is
connecting to the 5GS, thus different MAC addresses may be used as
source address of different frames sent UL over a single PDU Session
(and destination MAC address of different frames sent DL over the same
PDU Session).

NOTE 6: Entities on the LAN connected to the 5GS by the UE may have an
IP address allocated by the DN but the IP layer is considered as an
application layer which is not part of the Ethernet PDU Session.

NOTE 7: In this Release of the specification, only the UE connected to
the 5GS is authenticated, not the devices behind such UE.

NOTE 8: 5GS does not support the scenario where a MAC address or if VLAN
applies a (MAC address, VLAN) combination is used on more than one PDU
Session for the same DNN and S-NSSAI.

NOTE 9: This Release of the specification does not guarantee that the
Ethernet network remains loop-free. Deployments need to be verified on
an individual basis that loops in the Ethernet network are avoided.

NOTE 10: This Release of the specification does not guarantee that the
Ethernet network properly and quickly reacts to topology changes.
Deployments need to be verified on an individual basis how they react to
topology changes.

Different Frames exchanged on a PDU Session of Ethernet type may be
served with different QoS over the 5GS. Thus, the SMF may provide to the
UPF Ethernet Packet Filter Set and forwarding rule(s) based on the
Ethernet frame structure and UE MAC address(es). The UPF detects and
forwards Ethernet frames based on the Ethernet Packet Filter Set and
forwarding rule(s) received from the SMF. This is further defined in
clauses 5.7 and 5.8.2.

When a PDU Session of Ethernet PDU type is authorized by a DN as
described in clause 5.6.6, the DN-AAA server may, as part of
authorization data, provide the SMF with a list of allowed MAC addresses
for this PDU Session; the list is limited to a maximum of 16 MAC
addresses. When the list has been provided for a PDU Session, the SMF
sets corresponding filtering rules in the UPF(s) acting as PDU Session
Anchor for the PDU Session. The UPF discards any UL traffic that does
not contain one of these MAC addresses as a source address if the list
of allowed MAC addresses is provided.

In this Release of specification, the PDU Session of Ethernet PDU
Session type is restricted to SSC mode 1 and SSC mode 2.

For a PDU Session established with the Ethernet PDU Session type, the
SMF may, upon PCF request, need to ensure reporting to the PCF of all
Ethernet MAC addresses used as UE address in a PDU Session. In this
case, as defined in clause 5.8.2.12, the SMF controls the UPF to report
the different MAC addresses used as source address of frames sent UL by
the UE in the PDU Session.

NOTE 11: This relates to whether AF control on a per MAC address is
allowed on the PDU Session as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of
TS 23.503 \[45\].

The PCF may activate or deactivate the reporting of the UE MAC address
using the \"UE MAC address change\" Policy Control Request Trigger as
defined in Table 6.1.3.5-1 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

The SMF may relocate the UPF acting as the PDU Session Anchor for an
Ethernet PDU Session as defined in clause 4.3.5.8 of TS 23.502 \[3\].
The relocation may be triggered by a mobility event such as a handover,
or may be triggered independent of UE mobility, e.g. due to load
balancing reasons. In order to relocate the PSA UPF, the reporting of
the UE MAC addresses needs to be activated by the SMF.

#### 5.6.10.3 Support of Unstructured PDU Session type

Different Point-to-Point (PtP) tunnelling techniques may be used to
deliver Unstructured PDU Session type data to the destination (e.g.
application server) in the Data Network via N6.

Point-to-point tunnelling based on UDP/IP encapsulation as described
below may be used. Other techniques may be supported. Regardless of
addressing scheme used from the UPF to the DN, the UPF shall be able to
map the address used between the UPF and the DN to the PDU Session.

When Point-to-Point tunnelling based on UDP/IPv6 is used, the following
considerations apply:

\- IPv6 prefix allocation for PDU Sessions are performed locally by the
(H-)SMF without involving the UE.

\- The UPF(s) acts as a transparent forwarding node for the payload
between the UE and the destination in the DN.

\- For uplink, the UPF forwards the received Unstructured PDU Session
type data to the destination in the data network over the N6 PtP tunnel
using UDP/IPv6 encapsulation.

\- For downlink, the destination in the data network sends the
Unstructured PDU Session type data using UDP/IPv6 encapsulation with the
IPv6 address of the PDU Session and the 3GPP defined UDP port for
Unstructured PDU Session type data. The UPF acting as PDU Session Anchor
decapsulates the received data (i.e. removes the UDP/IPv6 headers) and
forwards the data identified by the IPv6 prefix of the PDU Session for
delivery to the UE.

\- The (H-)SMF performs the IPv6 related operations but the IPv6 prefix
is not provided to the UE, i.e. Router Advertisements and DHCPv6 are not
performed. The SMF assigns an IPv6 Interface Identifier for the PDU
Session. The allocated IPv6 prefix identifies the PDU Session of the UE.

\- For AF influence on traffic routing (described in clause 5.6.7), when
the N6 PtP tunnelling is used over the DNAI and the AF provides, by
value, information about N6 traffic routing requirements in the AF
request, the AF provides N6 PtP tunnelling requirements (IPv6 address
and UDP port of the tunnel end in the DN) as the N6 traffic routing
information associated to the DNAI; when the SMF notifies the AF of UP
path management events, it includes the N6 PtP tunnel information
related to the UP (the IPv6 address and the 3GPP defined UDP port of the
tunnel end at the UPF) as N6 traffic routing information in the
notification.

In this Release of the specification there is support for maximum one 5G
QoS Flow per PDU Session of Type Unstructured.

In this Release of specification, the PDU Session of Unstructured PDU
Session type is restricted to SSC mode 1 and SSC mode 2.

The UE may acquire from the SMF, at PDU Session Establishment, the MTU
that the UE shall consider, see clause 5.6.10.4.

#### 5.6.10.4 Maximum Transfer Unit size considerations

In order to avoid data packet fragmentation between the UE and the UPF
acting as PSA, the link MTU size in the UE should be set to the value
provided by the network as part of the IP configuration. The link MTU
size for IPv4 is sent to the UE by including it in the PCO (see
TS 24.501 \[47\]). The link MTU size for IPv6 is sent to the UE by
including it in the IPv6 Router Advertisement message (see
RFC 4861 \[54\]).

NOTE 1: Ideally the network configuration ensures that for PDU Session
type IPv4v6 the link MTU values provided to the UE via PCO and in the
IPv6 Router Advertisement message are the same. In cases where this
condition cannot be met, the MTU size selected by the UE is unspecified.

When using a PDU Session type Unstructured, the maximum uplink packet
size, and when using Ethernet, the Ethernet frames\' payload, that the
UE should use may be provided by the network as a part of the session
management configuration by encoding it within the PCO (see
TS 24.501 \[47\]).

When using a PDU Session type Unstructured, to provide a consistent
environment for application developers, the network shall use a maximum
packet size of at least 128 octets (this applies to both uplink and
downlink).

When the MT and the TE are separated, the TE may either be
pre-configured to use a specific default MTU size or the TE may use an
MTU size provided by the network via the MT. Thus, it is not always
possible to set the MTU value by means of information provided by the
network.

NOTE 2: In network deployments that have MTU size of 1500 octets in the
transport network, providing a link MTU value of 1358 octets (as shown
in Figure J-1) to the UE as part of the IP configuration information
from the network will prevent the IP layer fragmentation within the
transport network between the UE and the UPF. For network deployments
that uniformly support transport with larger MTU size than 1500 octets
(for example with ethernet jumbo frames of MTU size up to 9216 octets),
providing a link MTU value of MTU minus 142 octets to the UE as part of
the IP configuration information from the network will prevent the IP
layer fragmentation within the transport network between the UE and the
UPF. Link MTU considerations are discussed further in Annex J.

NOTE 3: As the link MTU value is provided as a part of the session
management configuration information, a link MTU value can be provided
during each PDU Session establishment. In this release, dynamic
adjustment of link MTU for scenarios where MTU is not uniform across
transport are not addressed.

### 5.6.11 UE presence in Area of Interest reporting usage by SMF

When a PDU Session is established or modified, or when the user plane
path has been changed (e.g. UPF re-allocation/addition/removal), SMF may
determine an Area of Interest, e.g. based on UPF Service Area,
subscription by PCF for reporting UE presence in Presence Reporting
Area, etc.

For 3GPP access, the Area of Interest corresponds:

\- either to Presence Information that may correspond to:

\- a list of Tracking Areas; or

\- a list of Presence Reporting Area ID(s) and optionally the elements
comprising TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells identifiers
corresponding to the PRA ID(s); or

\- a LADN DNN.

For Non-3GPP access, the Area of Interest corresponds to:

\- N3GPP TAI (see clause 5.3.2.3).

For UE location change into or out of an \"area of interest\", the SMF
subscribes to \"UE mobility event notification\" service provided by AMF
for reporting of UE presence in Area of Interest as described in
clause 5.3.4.4. The AMF may send the UE location to the SMF along with
the notification, e.g. for UPF selection. Upon reception of a
notification from AMF, the SMF determines how to deal with the PDU
Session, e.g. reallocate UPF.

In the case of LADN, the SMF provides the LADN DNN to the AMF to
subscribe to \"UE mobility event notification\" for reporting UE
presence in LADN service area. Upon reception of a notification from the
AMF, the SMF determines how to deal with the PDU Session as described in
clause 5.6.5.

For use cases related to policy control and charging decisions, the PCF
may subscribe to event reporting from the SMF or the AMF, for UE
presence in a Presence Reporting Area.

A Presence Reporting Area can be:

\- A \"UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Area\", defined in the subscriber
profile and composed of a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or
cells identifiers in a PLMN; or derived from the Area of Interest
provided by the Application Function to the PCF (see clause 5.6.7) and
composed of a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells
identifiers in a PLMN; or

\- A \"Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Area\", predefined in
the AMF and composed of a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or
cells identifiers in a PLMN.

In the case of Change of UE Presence in Presence Reporting Area, for
core network predefined Presence Reporting Area, the AMF determines the
\"area of interest\" corresponding to the Presence Reporting Area
Identifier(s), provided by the PCF or the SMF, as a list of TAIs and/or
cell identifiers and/or NG-RAN node identifiers based on local
configuration. For UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Areas, the
subscription for UE location change notification for an \"area of
interest\" shall contain the PRA Identifier(s) and the list(s) of TAs,
or NG-RAN Node identifier and/or cell identifiers composing the Presence
Reporting Area(s). For Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas,
the subscription for UE location change notification for an \"area of
interest\" shall contain the PRA identifier(s).

NOTE 1: If the Presence Reporting Area (PRA) and RAN Notification Area
(RNA) are partially overlapping, the PCF will not get notified for the
change of PRA when UE enters or leaves the PRA but remains in the RNA in
CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, because AMF is not informed.

Each Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Area can be configured
with a priority level in the AMF. In order to prevent overload, the AMF
may set the reporting for one or more of the received Presence Reporting
Area(s) to inactive under consideration of the priority configured for
each of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Area(s), while
storing the reporting request for this Presence Reporting Area in the UE
context.

NOTE 2: Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area reporting does
not apply to home routed roaming.

The AMF may be configured with a PRA identifier which refers to a Set of
Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas. If the PCF subscribes
to change of UE location for an area of interest for a Set of Presence
reporting areas and provides a PRA identifier then the SMF may subscribe
for event reporting for this Set of Presence Reporting Areas by only
indicating this PRA Identifier in the area of interest. When the
Presence Reporting Area(s) to be reported belong to a set of Core
Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas in which the AMF is
requested to report on change of UE presence, the AMF shall additionally
add to the report the PRA Identifier of the Set of Core Network
predefined Presence Reporting Areas.

Upon change of AMF, the PRA identifier(s) and if provided, the list(s)
of Presence Reporting Area elements are transferred for all PDU sessions
as part of MM Context information to the target AMF during the mobility
procedure. If one or more Presence Reporting Area(s) was set to
inactive, the target AMF may decide to reactivate one or more of the
inactive Presence Reporting Area(s). The target AMF indicates per PDU
session to the corresponding SMF/PCF the PRA identifier(s) and whether
the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting Area(s) as well as
the inactive Presence Reporting Area(s), if any.

NOTE 3: The target AMF cannot set the Presence Reporting Area(s)
received from the source serving node to inactive.

The subscription may be maintained during the life of PDU Session,
regardless of the UP activation state of PDU Session (i.e. whether UP
connection of the PDU Session is activated or not).

SMF may determine a new area of interest, and send a new subscription to
the AMF with the new area of interest.

SMF un-subscribes to \"UE mobility event notification\" service when PDU
Session is released.

### 5.6.12 Use of Network Instance

The SMF may provide a Network Instance to the UPF in FAR and/or PDR via
N4 Session Establishment or N4 Modification procedures.

NOTE 1: a Network Instance can be defined e.g. to separate IP domains,
e.g. when a UPF is connected to 5G-ANs in different IP domains,
overlapping UE IP addresses assigned by multiple Data Networks,
transport network isolation in the same PLMN, etc.

NOTE 2: As the SMF can provide over N2 the Network Instance it has
selected for the N3 CN Tunnel Info, the 5G AN does not need to provide
Network Instance to the 5GC.

The SMF determines the Network Instance based on local configuration.

The SMF may determine the Network Instance for N3 and N9 interfaces,
taking into account e.g. UE location, registered PLMN ID of UE, S-NSSAI
of the PDU Session.

The SMF may determine the Network Instance for N6 interface taking into
account e.g. (DNN, S-NSSAI) of the PDU Session.

The SMF may determine the Network Instance for N19 interface taking into
account e.g. the (DNN, S-NSSAI) identifying a 5G VN group.

NOTE 3: As an example, the UPF can use the Network Instance included in
the FAR, together with other information such as Outer header creation
(IP address part) and Destination interface in the FAR, to determine the
interface in UPF (e.g. VPN or Layer 2 technology) for forwarding of the
traffic.

### 5.6.13 Always-on PDU session

An always-on PDU Session is a PDU Session for which User Plane resources
have to be activated during every transition from CM-IDLE mode to
CM-CONNECTED state.

Based on an indication from upper layers, a UE may request to establish
a PDU Session as an always-on PDU Session. The SMF decides whether the
PDU Session can be established as an always-on PDU Session. In Home
Routed roaming case, based on local policies, the V-SMF shall be
involved to determine whether the PDU Session can be established as an
always-on PDU Session.

If the UE requests the 5GC to modify a PDU Session, which was
established in EPS, to an always-on PDU Session after the first
inter-system change from EPS to 5GS, the SMF decides whether the PDU
Session can be established as an always-on PDU Session based on the
procedure described above.

The UE shall request activation of User Plane resources for always-on
PDU Sessions even if there are no pending uplink data for this PDU
Session or when the Service Request is triggered for signalling only or
when the Service Request is triggered for paging response only.

If the UE has one or more established PDU Sessions which are not
accepted by the network as always-on PDU Sessions and the UE has no
uplink user data pending to be sent for those PDU Sessions, the UE shall
not request for activating User Plane resources for those PDU sessions.

### 5.6.14 Support of Framed Routing

Framed Routing is only defined for PDU Sessions of the IP type (IPv4,
IPv6, IPv4v6) and allows to support an IP network behind a UE, such that
a range of IPv4 addresses or IPv6 prefixes is reachable over a single
PDU Session, e.g. for enterprise connectivity. Framed Routes are IP
routes behind the UE.

A PDU Session may be associated with multiple Framed Routes. Each Framed
Route refers to a range of IPv4 addresses (i.e. an IPv4 address and an
IPv4 address mask) or a range of IPv6 Prefixes (i.e. an IPv6 Prefix and
an IPv6 Prefix length). The set of one or more Framed Routes associated
to a PDU Session is contained in the Framed Route information. The
network does not send Framed Route information to the UE: devices in the
network(s) behind the UE get their IP address by mechanisms out of the
scope of 3GPP specifications. See RFC 2865 \[73\], RFC 3162 \[74\].

Framed Route information is provided by the SMF to the UPF (acting as
PSA) as part of Packet Detection Rule (PDR, see clause 5.8.2.11.3)
related with the network side (N6) of the UPF.

NOTE: SMF can take the UPF capabilities into account when selecting PSA
UPF, to ensure that the SMF chooses PSA UPF(s) that support Framed
Routing for PDU Sessions to DNN and/or slices deemed to support Framed
Routing e.g. DNN and/or slices intended to support RG or if Framed Route
information has been received as part of Session Management Subscription
data.

The Framed Route information may be provided to the SMF by:

\- the DN-AAA server as part of PDU Session Establishment
authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA server (as defined in
clause 5.6.6); or by

\- Session Management Subscription data associated with DNN and S-NSSAI
sent by UDM (as defined in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

If the SMF receives Framed Route information both from DN-AAA and from
UDM, the information received from DN-AAA takes precedence and
supersedes the information received from UDM.

The IPv4 address / IPv6 Prefix allocated to the UE as part of the PDU
Session establishment (e.g. delivered in NAS PDU Session Establishment
Accept) may belong to one of the Framed Routes associated with the PDU
Session or may be dynamically allocated outside of such Framed Routes.

If PCC applies to the PDU Session, at PDU Session establishment the SMF
reports to the PCF the Framed Route information corresponding to the PDU
Session (as described in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 \[45\]). In this
case, in order to support session binding, the PCF may further report to
the BSF the Framed Route information corresponding to the PDU Session
(as described in clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.503 \[45\]).

If the UDM or DN-AAA updates the Framed Route information during the
lifetime of the PDU Session, the SMF releases the PDU Session and may
include in the release request an indication for the UE to re-establish
the PDU Session.

### 5.6.15 Triggers for network analytics

Triggers for the SMF to request for or subscribe to the analytics
information from the NWDAF are internal logic may include for example:

\- UE PDU Session related event subscription by other NFs (e.g. AMF,
NEF);

\- UE access and mobility event reports from the AMF;

\- locally detected events;

\- analytics information received.

The trigger conditions may depend on operator and implementation policy
in the SMF. When a trigger condition happens, the SMF may decide if any
analytics information is needed and if so, request for or subscription
to the analytics information from the NWDAF.

The SMF may, upon detection of certain local events, e.g. number of PDU
sessions establishment or released reaches a threshold in a specific
area, request for or subscribe to network analytics related to
\"Abnormal behaviour\" as described in TS 23.288 \[86\] to detect
whether there are any exceptional UE behaviours in this area.

## 5.7 QoS model

### 5.7.1 General Overview

#### 5.7.1.1 QoS Flow

The 5G QoS model is based on QoS Flows. The 5G QoS model supports both
QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows) and QoS
Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).
The 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5).

The QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in the PDU
Session. A QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G
System. User Plane traffic with the same QFI within a PDU Session
receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling,
admission threshold). The QFI is carried in an encapsulation header on
N3 (and N9) i.e. without any changes to the e2e packet header. QFI shall
be used for all PDU Session Types. The QFI shall be unique within a PDU
Session. The QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5QI
(see clause 5.7.2.1).

Within the 5GS, a QoS Flow is controlled by the SMF and may be
preconfigured, or established via the PDU Session Establishment
procedure (see clause 4.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), or the PDU Session
Modification procedure (see clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Any QoS Flow is characterised by:

\- A QoS profile provided by the SMF to the AN via the AMF over the N2
reference point or preconfigured in the AN;

\- One or more QoS rule(s) and optionally QoS Flow level QoS parameters
(as specified in TS 24.501 \[47\]) associated with these QoS rule(s)
which can be provided by the SMF to the UE via the AMF over the N1
reference point and/or derived by the UE by applying Reflective QoS
control; and

\- One or more UL and DL PDR(s) provided by the SMF to the UPF.

Within the 5GS, a QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule is
required to be established for a PDU Session and remains established
throughout the lifetime of the PDU Session. This QoS Flow should be a
Non-GBR QoS Flow (further details are described in clause 5.7.2.7).

A QoS Flow is associated with QoS requirements as specified by QoS
parameters and QoS characteristics.

NOTE: The QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule provides the UE
with connectivity throughout the lifetime of the PDU Session. Possible
interworking with EPS motivates the recommendation for this QoS Flow to
be of type Non-GBR.

#### 5.7.1.2 QoS Profile

A QoS Flow may either be \'GBR\' or \'Non-GBR\' depending on its QoS
profile. The QoS profile of a QoS Flow is sent to the (R)AN and it
contains QoS parameters as described below (details of QoS parameters
are described in clause 5.7.2):

\- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile shall include the QoS parameters:

\- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and

\- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).

\- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile may also include the
QoS parameter:

\- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).

\- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile shall also include the
QoS parameters:

\- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - UL and DL; and

\- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and

\- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile may also include
one or more of the QoS parameters:

\- Notification control;

\- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL.

NOTE: In this Release of the specification, the Maximum Packet Loss Rate
(UL, DL) is only provided for a GBR QoS Flow belonging to voice media.

Each QoS profile has one corresponding QoS Flow identifier (QFI) which
is not included in the QoS profile itself.

The usage of a dynamically assigned 5QI for a QoS Flow requires in
addition the signalling of the complete 5G QoS characteristics
(described in clause 5.7.3) as part of the QoS profile.

When a standardized or pre-configured 5QI is used for a QoS Flow, some
of the 5G QoS characteristics may be signalled as part of the QoS
profile (as described in clause 5.7.3).

#### 5.7.1.2a Alternative QoS Profile

The Alternative QoS Profile(s) can be optionally provided for a GBR QoS
Flow with Notification control enabled. If the corresponding PCC rule
contains the related information (as described in TS 23.503 \[45\]), the
SMF shall provide, in addition to the QoS profile, a prioritized list of
Alternative QoS Profile(s) to the NG-RAN. If the SMF provides a new
prioritized list of Alternative QoS Profile(s) to the NG-RAN (if the
corresponding PCC rule information changes), the NG-RAN shall replace
any previously stored list with it.

An Alternative QoS Profile represents a combination of QoS parameters
PDB, PER and GFBR to which the application traffic is able to adapt.

NOTE 1: There is no requirement that the GFBR monotonically decreases,
nor that the PDB or PER monotonically increase as the Alternative QoS
Profiles become less preferred.

When the NG-RAN sends a notification to the SMF that the QoS profile is
not fulfilled, the NG-RAN shall, if the currently fulfilled values match
an Alternative QoS Profile, include also the reference to the
Alternative QoS Profile to indicate the QoS that the NG-RAN currently
fulfils (see clause 5.7.2.4). The NG-RAN shall enable the SMF to
determine when an NG-RAN node supports the Alternative QoS feature but
cannot fulfil even the least preferred Alternative QoS Profile.

NOTE 2: To reduce the risk that GBR QoS Flows are released in case of
RAN resource limitations (and then experience difficulties in being
re-established), Application Functions can set the least preferred
Alternative Service Requirement to an undemanding level.

#### 5.7.1.3 Control of QoS Flows

The following options are supported to control QoS Flows:

1\) For Non-GBR QoS Flows, and when standardized 5QIs or pre-configured
5QIs are used and when the 5QI is within the range of the QFI (i.e. a
value less than 64), the 5QI value may be used as the QFI of the QoS
Flow.

\(a\) A default ARP shall be pre-configured in the AN; or

\(b\) The ARP and the QFI shall be sent to RAN over N2 at PDU Session
Establishment or at PDU Session Modification and when NG-RAN is used
every time the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated; and

2\) For all other cases (including GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows), a
dynamically assigned QFI shall be used. The 5QI value may be a
standardized, pre-configured or dynamically assigned. The QoS profile
and the QFI of a QoS Flow shall be provided to the (R)AN over N2 at PDU
Session Establishment/Modification and when NG-RAN is used every time
the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated.

Only options 1b and 2 may apply to 3GPP ANs. Options 1a, 1b and 2 may
apply to Non-3GPP access.

NOTE: Pre-configured 5QI values cannot be used when the UE is roaming.

#### 5.7.1.4 QoS Rules

The UE performs the classification and marking of UL User plane traffic,
i.e. the association of UL traffic to QoS Flows, based on QoS rules.
These QoS rules may be explicitly provided to the UE (i.e. explicitly
signalled QoS rules using the PDU Session Establishment/Modification
procedure), pre-configured in the UE or implicitly derived by the UE by
applying Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5). A QoS rule contains the QFI
of the associated QoS Flow, a Packet Filter Set (see clause 5.7.6) and a
precedence value (see clause 5.7.1.9). An explicitly signalled QoS rule
contains a QoS rule identifier which is unique within the PDU Session
and is generated by SMF.

There can be more than one QoS rule associated with the same QoS Flow
(i.e. with the same QFI).

When the UE informs the network about the number of supported Packet
Filters for signalled QoS rules for the PDU Session (during the PDU
Session Establishment procedure or using the PDU Session Modification
procedure as described in clause 5.17.2.2.2 after the first inter-system
change from EPS to 5GS for a PDU Session established in EPS and
transferred from EPS with N26 interface), the SMF shall ensure that the
sum of the Packet Filters used by all signalled QoS rules for a PDU
Session does not exceed the number indicated by the UE.

A default QoS rule is required to be sent to the UE for every PDU
Session establishment and it is associated with a QoS Flow. For IP type
PDU Session or Ethernet type PDU Session, the default QoS rule is the
only QoS rule of a PDU Session which may contain a Packet Filter Set
that allows all UL packets, and in this case, the highest precedence
value shall be used for the QoS rule.

NOTE 2: How the UE evaluates UL packets against the Packet Filter Set in
a QoS rule is described in clause 5.7.1.5.

NOTE 3: The QoS rule pre-configured in the UE is only used together with
option 1a for control QoS Flows as described in clause 5.7.1.3. How to
keep the consistency of QFI and Packet Filter Set between UE and network
is out of scope in this release of the specification.

For Unstructured type PDU Session, the default QoS rule does not contain
a Packet Filter Set, and in this case the default QoS rule defines the
treatment of all packets in the PDU Session.

As long as the default QoS rule does not contain a Packet Filter Set or
contains a Packet Filter Set that allows all UL packets, Reflective QoS
should not be applied for the QoS Flow which the default QoS rule is
associated with and the RQA should not be sent for this QoS Flow.

#### 5.7.1.5 QoS Flow mapping

The SMF performs the binding of PCC rules to QoS Flows based on the QoS
and service requirements (as defined in TS 23.503 \[45\]). The SMF
assigns the QFI for a new QoS Flow and derives its QoS profile,
corresponding UPF instructions and QoS Rule(s) from the PCC rule(s)
bound to the QoS Flow and other information provided by the PCF.

When applicable, the SMF provides the following information for the QoS
Flow to the (R)AN:

\- QFI;

\- QoS profile as described in clause 5.7.1.2.

\- optionally, Alternative QoS Profile(s) as described in
clause 5.7.1.2a;

For each PCC rule bound to a QoS Flow, the SMF provides the following
information to the UPF enabling classification, bandwidth enforcement
and marking of User Plane traffic (the details are described in
clause 5.8):

\- a DL PDR containing the DL part of the SDF template;

\- an UL PDR containing the UL part of the SDF template;

NOTE 1: If a DL PDR for an bidirectional SDF is associated with a QoS
Flow other than the one associated with the default QoS rule and the UE
has not received any instruction to use this QoS Flow for the SDF in
uplink direction (i.e. neither a corresponding QoS rule is sent to the
UE nor the Reflective QoS Indication is set in the PCC rule), it means
that the UL PDR for the same SDF has to be associated with the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule.

\- the PDR precedence value (see clause 5.7.1.9) for both PDRs is set to
the precedence value of the PCC rule;

\- QoS related information (e.g. MBR for an SDF, GFBR and MFBR for a GBR
QoS Flow) as described in clause 5.8.2;

\- the corresponding packet marking information (e.g. the QFI, the
transport level packet marking value (e.g. the DSCP value of the outer
IP header);

\- optionally, the Reflective QoS Indication is included in the QER
associated with the DL PDR (as described in clause 5.7.5.3).

For each PCC rule bound to a QoS Flow, when applicable, the SMF
generates an explicitly signalled QoS rule (see clause 5.7.1.4)
according to the following principles and provides it to the UE together
with an add operation:

\- A unique (for the PDU Session) QoS rule identifier is assigned;

\- The QFI in the QoS rule is set to the QFI of the QoS Flow to which
the PCC rule is bound;

\- The Packet Filter Set of the QoS rule is generated from the UL SDF
filters and optionally the DL SDF filters of the PCC rule (but only from
those SDF filters that have an indication for being signalled to the UE,
as defined in TS 23.503 \[45\]);

\- The QoS rule precedence value is set to the precedence value of the
PCC rule for which the QoS rule is generated;

\- for a dynamically assigned QFI, the QoS Flow level QoS parameters
(e.g. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR, Averaging Window, see TS 24.501 \[47\]) are
signalled to UE in addition to the QoS rule(s) associated to the QoS
Flow. The QoS Flow level QoS parameters of an existing QoS Flow may be
updated based on the MBR and GBR information received in the PCC rule
(MBR and GBR per SDF are however not provided to UE over N1 in the case
of more than one SDF) or, if the PCF has not indicated differently, when
Notification control or handover related signalling indicates that the
QoS parameter the NG-RAN is currently fulfilling for the QoS Flow have
changed (see clause 5.7.2.4).

Changes in the binding of PCC rules to QoS Flows as well as changes in
the PCC rules or other information provided by the PCF can require QoS
Flow changes which the SMF has to provide to (R)AN, UPF and/or UE. In
the case of changes in the explicitly signalled QoS rules associated to
a QoS Flow, the SMF provides the explicitly signalled QoS rules and
their operation (i.e. add/modify/delete) to the UE.

NOTE 2: The SMF cannot provide, update or remove pre-configured QoS
rules or UE derived QoS rules.

The principle for classification and marking of User Plane traffic and
mapping of QoS Flows to AN resources is illustrated in Figure 5.7.1.5-1.

![](media/image64.emf)

Figure 5.7.1.5-1: The principle for classification and User Plane
marking for QoS Flows and mapping to AN Resources

In DL, incoming data packets are classified by the UPF based on the
Packet Filter Sets of the DL PDRs in the order of their precedence
(without initiating additional N4 signalling). The UPF conveys the
classification of the User Plane traffic belonging to a QoS Flow through
an N3 (and N9) User Plane marking using a QFI. The AN binds QoS Flows to
AN resources (i.e. Data Radio Bearers of in the case of 3GPP RAN). There
is no strict 1:1 relation between QoS Flows and AN resources. It is up
to the AN to establish the necessary AN resources that QoS Flows can be
mapped to, and to release them. The AN shall indicate to the SMF when
the AN resources onto which a QoS Flow is mapped are released.

If no matching DL PDR is found, the UPF shall discard the DL data
packet.

In UL:

\- For a PDU Session of Type IP or Ethernet, the UE evaluates UL packets
against the UL Packet Filters in the Packet Filter Set in the QoS rules
based on the precedence value of QoS rules in increasing order until a
matching QoS rule (i.e. whose Packet Filter matches the UL packet) is
found.

\- If no matching QoS rule is found, the UE shall discard the UL data
packet.

\- For a PDU Session of Type Unstructured, the default QoS rule does not
contain a Packet Filter Set and allows all UL packets.

NOTE 3: Only the default QoS rule exist for a PDU Session of Type
Unstructured.

The UE uses the QFI in the corresponding matching QoS rule to bind the
UL packet to a QoS Flow. The UE then binds QoS Flows to AN resources.

#### 5.7.1.6 DL traffic

The following characteristics apply for processing of DL traffic:

\- UPF maps User Plane traffic to QoS Flows based on the PDRs.

\- UPF performs Session-AMBR enforcement as specified in clause 5.7.1.8
and performs counting of packets for charging.

\- UPF transmits the PDUs of the PDU Session in a single tunnel between
5GC and (R)AN, the UPF includes the QFI in the encapsulation header. In
addition, UPF may include an indication for Reflective QoS activation in
the encapsulation header.

\- UPF performs transport level packet marking in DL on a per QoS Flow
basis. The UPF uses the transport level packet marking value provided by
the SMF (as described in clause 5.8.2.7).

\- (R)AN maps PDUs from QoS Flows to access-specific resources based on
the QFI and the associated 5G QoS profile, also taking into account the
N3 tunnel associated with the DL packet.

NOTE: Packet Filters are not used for the mapping of QoS Flows onto
access-specific resources in (R)AN.

\- If Reflective QoS applies, the UE creates a new derived QoS rule as
defined in clause 5.7.5.2.

#### 5.7.1.7 UL Traffic

Following characteristics apply for processing of UL traffic:

\- UE uses the stored QoS rules to determine mapping between UL User
Plane traffic and QoS Flows. UE marks the UL PDU with the QFI of the QoS
rule containing the matching Packet Filter and transmits the UL PDUs
using the corresponding access specific resource for the QoS Flow based
on the mapping provided by (R)AN. For NG-RAN, the UL behaviour is
specified in clause 10.5.2 of TS 38.300 \[27\].

\- (R)AN transmits the PDUs over N3 tunnel towards UPF. When passing an
UL packet from (R)AN to CN, the (R)AN includes the QFI value, in the
encapsulation header of the UL PDU, and selects the N3 tunnel.

\- (R)AN performs transport level packet marking in the UL on a per QoS
Flow basis with a transport level packet marking value that is
determined based on the 5QI, the Priority Level (if explicitly
signalled) and the ARP priority level of the associated QoS Flow.

\- UPF verifies whether QFIs in the UL PDUs are aligned with the QoS
Rules provided to the UE or implicitly derived by the UE in the case of
Reflective QoS).

\- UPF and UE perform Session-AMBR enforcement as specified in
clause 5.7.1.8 and the UPF performs counting of packets for charging.

#### 5.7.1.8 AMBR/MFBR enforcement and rate limitation

UL and DL Session-AMBR (see clause 5.7.2.6) shall be enforced by the
UPF, if the UPF receives the Session-AMBR values from the SMF as
described in clause 5.8.2.7 and clause 5.8.2.11.4.

For UL Classifier PDU Sessions, UL and DL Session-AMBR (see
clause 5.7.2.6) shall be enforced in the SMF selected UPF that supports
the UL Classifier functionality. In addition, the DL Session-AMBR shall
be enforced separately in every UPF that terminates the N6 interface
(i.e. without requiring interaction between the UPFs) (see
clause 5.6.4).

For multi-homed PDU Sessions, UL and DL Session-AMBR shall be enforced
in the UPF that supports the Branching Point functionality. In addition,
the DL Session-AMBR shall be enforced separately in every UPF that
terminates the N6 interface (i.e. without requiring interaction between
the UPFs) (see clause 5.6.4).

NOTE: The DL Session-AMBR is enforced in every UPF terminating the N6
interface to reduce unnecessary transport of traffic which may be
discarded by the UPF performing the UL Classifier/Branching Point
functionality due to the amount of the DL traffic for the PDU Session
exceeding the DL Session-AMBR. Discarding DL packets in the UL
Classifier/Branching Point could cause erroneous PDU counting for
support of charging

The (R)AN shall enforce UE-AMBR (see clause 5.7.2.6) in UL and DL per UE
for Non-GBR QoS Flows.

The UE shall perform UL rate limitation on PDU Session basis for Non-GBR
traffic using Session-AMBR, if the UE receives a Session-AMBR.

MBR per SDF is mandatory for GBR QoS Flows but optional for Non-GBR QoS
Flows. The MBR is enforced in the UPF.

The MFBR is enforced in the UPF in the Downlink for GBR QoS Flows. The
MFBR is enforced in the (R)AN in the Downlink and Uplink for GBR QoS
Flows. For non-3GPP access, the UE should enforce MFBR in the Uplink for
GBR QoS Flows.

The QoS control for Unstructured PDUs is performed at the PDU Session
level and in this Release of the specification there is only support for
maximum of one 5G QoS Flow per PDU Session of Type Unstructured.

When a PDU Session is set up for transferring unstructured PDUs, SMF
provides the QFI which will be applied to any packet of the PDU Session
to the UPF and UE.

#### 5.7.1.9 Precedence Value

The QoS rule precedence value and the PDR precedence value determine the
order in which a QoS rule or a PDR, respectively, shall be evaluated.
The evaluation of the QoS rules or PDRs is performed in increasing order
of their precedence value.

#### 5.7.1.10 UE-Slice-MBR enforcement and rate limitation

If a supporting RAN receives for a UE a UE-Slice-MBR (see
clause 5.7.2.6) for an S-NSSAI from the AMF, the RAN shall apply this
UE-Slice-MBR for all PDU Sessions of that UE corresponding to the
S-NSSAI which have an active user plane if feasible. In particular, the
RAN shall enforce this UE-Slice-MBR as follows:

1\) Whenever a request for a GBR QoS Flow establishment or modification
is received, the RAN admission control shall ensure that the sum of the
GFBR values of the admitted GBR QoS Flows is not exceeding the
UE-Slice-MBR and, if the QoS Flow cannot be admitted, the RAN shall
reject the establishment/modification of the QoS Flow.

2\) The RAN shall ensure that the aggregated bitrate across all GBR and
Non-GBR QoS Flows belonging to those PDU Sessions is not exceeding the
UE-Slice-MBR, while always guaranteeing the GFBR of every GBR QoS Flow
of those PDU Sessions as described in clause 5.7.2.5.

#### 5.7.1.11 QoS aspects of home-routed roaming

In the case of home-routed roaming, the V-SMF may apply VPLMN policies
related with the SLA negotiated with the HPLMN or with QoS values
supported by the VPLMN. Such policies may result in a situation that the
V-SMF does not accept the PDU Session or does not accept some of the QoS
Flows requested by the H-SMF.

QoS constraints represent the QoS that the VPLMN can accept for the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule and the PDU Session based on
SLA or based on QoS values supported by the VPLMN. The QoS constraints
may contain 5QI and ARP for the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule and highest Session-AMBR accepted by the VPLMN.

At PDU Session Establishment for home-routed roaming, to reduce the risk
of PDU Session establishment failure due to QoS from the HPLMN not being
compliant with SLA, the V-SMF may provide the VPLMN local policy in QoS
constraints to the H-SMF as specified in clause 4.3.2.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

For intra-5GS mobility with V-SMF insertion or V-SMF change (e.g.
inter-PLMN mobility), as specified in clause 4.23 of TS 23.502 \[3\],
the new/target V-SMF may validate the currently applied QoS against the
QoS constraints. The new/target V-SMF provides QoS constraints to the
H-SMF during the mobility procedure. The new/target V-SMF may
temporarily accept a higher QoS even if the currently applied QoS
exceeds the QoS constraints. Alternatively, for the QoS parameters
related with the QoS constraints, the V-SMF may locally downgrade these
values before providing the corresponding QoS profiles to 5G AN. The
V-SMF may decide to release the PDU Session if the HPLMN does not
provide updated QoS compliant with the QoS constraints after the
mobility procedure.

For IMS voice service (e.g., the IMS DNN defined by the GSMA), the
V-SMF, based on local policy, may override the ARP received from HPLMN
over N16 if the ARP indicates priority not in line with the local policy
in VPLMN. The ARP override in the serving PLMN applies to both the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule and the QoS Flows for IMS
voice, to apply the same allocation and retention priority for all users
(i.e., roamers and non-roamers). For MPS (clause 5.16.5), the same
allocation and retention priority is applied to all MPS service users
(i.e. roamers and non-roamers), when roaming agreements are in place and
where regulatory requirements apply.

### 5.7.2 5G QoS Parameters

#### 5.7.2.1 5QI

A 5QI is a scalar that is used as a reference to 5G QoS characteristics
defined in clause 5.7.4, i.e. access node-specific parameters that
control QoS forwarding treatment for the QoS Flow (e.g. scheduling
weights, admission thresholds, queue management thresholds, link layer
protocol configuration, etc.).

Standardized 5QI values have one-to-one mapping to a standardized
combination of 5G QoS characteristics as specified in Table 5.7.4-1.

The 5G QoS characteristics for pre-configured 5QI values are
pre-configured in the AN.

Standardized or pre-configured 5G QoS characteristics, are indicated
through the 5QI value, and are not signalled on any interface, unless
certain 5G QoS characteristics are modified as specified in clauses
5.7.3.3, 5.7.3.4, 5.7.3.6, and 5.7.3.7.

The 5G QoS characteristics for QoS Flows with dynamically assigned 5QI
are signalled as part of the QoS profile.

NOTE: On N3, each PDU (i.e. in the tunnel used for the PDU Session) is
associated with one 5QI via the QFI carried in the encapsulation header.

#### 5.7.2.2 ARP

The QoS parameter ARP contains information about the priority level, the
pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability. This allows
deciding whether a QoS Flow establishment/modification/handover may be
accepted or needs to be rejected in the case of resource limitations
(typically used for admission control of GBR traffic). It may also be
used to decide which existing QoS Flow to pre-empt during resource
limitations, i.e. which QoS Flow to release to free up resources.

The ARP priority level defines the relative importance of a QoS Flow.
The range of the ARP priority level is 1 to 15 with 1 as the highest
priority.

The ARP priority levels 1-8 should only be assigned to QoS Flows for
services that are authorized to receive prioritized treatment within an
operator domain (i.e. that are authorized by the serving network). The
ARP priority levels 9-15 may be assigned to QoS Flows for services that
are authorized by the home network and thus applicable when a UE is
roaming.

NOTE: This ensures that future releases may use ARP priority level 1-8
to indicate e.g. emergency and other priority services within an
operator domain in a backward compatible manner. This does not prevent
the use of ARP priority level 1-8 in roaming situation in the case that
appropriate roaming agreements exist that ensure a compatible use of
these priority levels.

The ARP pre-emption capability defines whether a QoS Flow may get
resources that were already assigned to another QoS Flow with a lower
priority. The ARP pre-emption vulnerability defines whether a QoS Flow
may lose the resources assigned to it in order to admit a QoS Flow with
higher priority. The ARP pre-emption capability and the ARP pre-emption
vulnerability shall be either set to \'enabled\' or \'disabled\'.

The ARP pre-emption vulnerability of the QoS Flow which the default QoS
rule is associated with should be set appropriately to minimize the risk
of a release of this QoS Flow.

The details of how the SMF sets the ARP for a QoS Flow are further
described in clause 5.7.2.7.

#### 5.7.2.3 RQA

The Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA) is an optional parameter which
indicates that certain traffic (not necessarily all) carried on this QoS
Flow is subject to Reflective QoS. Only when the RQA is signalled for a
QoS Flow, the (R)AN enables the transfer of the RQI for AN resource
corresponding to this QoS Flow. The RQA may be signalled to NG-RAN via
the N2 reference point at UE context establishment in NG-RAN and at QoS
Flow establishment or modification.

#### 5.7.2.4 Notification control

##### 5.7.2.4.1 General

The QoS Parameter Notification control indicates whether notifications
are requested from the NG-RAN when the \"GFBR can no longer (or can
again) be guaranteed\" for a QoS Flow during the lifetime of the QoS
Flow. Notification control may be used for a GBR QoS Flow if the
application traffic is able to adapt to the change in the QoS (e.g. if
the AF is capable to trigger rate adaptation).

The SMF shall only enable Notification control when the QoS Notification
Control parameter is set in the PCC rule (received from the PCF) that is
bound to the QoS Flow. The Notification control parameter is signalled
to the NG-RAN as part of the QoS profile.

##### 5.7.2.4.1a Notification Control without Alternative QoS Profiles

If, for a given GBR QoS Flow, Notification control is enabled and the
NG-RAN determines that the GFBR, the PDB or the PER of the QoS profile
cannot be fulfilled, NG-RAN shall send a notification towards SMF that
the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\". Furthermore, the NG-RAN shall
keep the QoS Flow (i.e. while the NG-RAN is not fulfilling the requested
QoS profile for this QoS Flow), unless specific conditions at the NG-RAN
require the release of the NG-RAN resources for this GBR QoS Flow, e.g.
due to Radio link failure or RAN internal congestion. The NG-RAN should
try to fulfil the GFBR, the PDB and the PER of the QoS profile again.

NOTE 1: NG-RAN can decide that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\"
based on, e.g. measurements like queuing delay or system load.

Upon receiving a notification from the NG-RAN that the \"GFBR can no
longer be guaranteed\", the SMF may forward the notification to the PCF,
see TS 23.503 \[45\].

When the NG-RAN determines that the GFBR, the PDB and the PER of the QoS
profile can be fulfilled again for a QoS Flow (for which a notification
that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" has been sent), the NG-RAN
shall send a notification, informing the SMF that the \"GFBR can be
guaranteed\" again and the SMF may forward the notification to the PCF,
see TS 23.503 \[45\]. The NG-RAN shall send a subsequent notification
that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" whenever necessary.

NOTE 2: It is assumed that NG-RAN implementation will apply some
hysteresis before determining that the \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\"
and therefore a frequent signalling of \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\"
followed by \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" is not expected.

NOTE 3: If the QoS Flow is modified, the NG-RAN restarts the check
whether the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" according to the
updated QoS profile. If the Notification control parameter is not
included in the updated QoS profile, the Notification control is
disabled.

During a handover, the Source NG-RAN does not inform the Target NG-RAN
about whether the Source NG-RAN has sent a notification for a QoS Flow
that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\". The Target NG-RAN
performs admission control rejecting any QoS Flows for which resources
cannot be permanently allocated. The accepted QoS Flows are included in
the N2 Path Switch Request or N2 Handover Request Acknowledge message
from the NG-RAN to the AMF. The SMF shall interpret the fact that a QoS
Flow is listed as transferred QoS Flow in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request received from the AMF as a
notification that \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\" for this QoS Flow
unless the SMF is also receiving a reference to an Alternative QoS
Profile for this QoS Flow (which is described in clause 5.7.2.4.2).
After the handover is successfully completed, the Target NG-RAN shall
send a subsequent notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be
guaranteed\" for such a QoS Flow whenever necessary. If the SMF has
previously notified the PCF that the \"GFBR can no longer be
guaranteed\" and the SMF does not receive an explicit notification that
the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" for that QoS Flow from the
Target NG-RAN within a configured time, the SMF shall notify the PCF
that the \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\".

##### 5.7.2.4.1b Notification control with Alternative QoS Profiles

If, for a given GBR QoS Flow, Notification control is enabled and the
NG-RAN has received a list of Alternative QoS Profile(s) for this QoS
Flow and supports the Alternative QoS Profile handling, the following
shall apply:

1\) If the NG-RAN determines that the GFBR, the PDB or the PER of the
QoS profile cannot be fulfilled, NG-RAN shall send a notification
towards SMF that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\". Before
sending a notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\"
towards the SMF, the NG-RAN shall check whether the GFBR, the PDB and
the PER that the NG-RAN currently fulfils match any of the Alternative
QoS Profile(s) in the indicated priority order. If there is a match, the
NG-RAN shall indicate the reference to the matching Alternative QoS
Profile with the highest priority together with the notification to the
SMF.

If there is no match, the NG-RAN shall send a notification that the
\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" towards the SMF indicating that the
lowest Alternative QoS Profile cannot be fulfilled (unless specific
conditions at the NG-RAN require the release of the NG-RAN resources for
this GBR QoS Flow, e.g. due to Radio link failure or RAN internal
congestion).

2\) If a notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" has
been sent to the SMF and the NG-RAN determines that the currently
fulfilled GFBR, PDB or PER are different (better or worse) from the
situation indicated in the last notification, the NG-RAN shall send a
notification (i.e. \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" or \"GFBR can be
guaranteed again\") to the SMF and indicate the current situation
(unless specific conditions at the NG-RAN require the release of the
NG-RAN resources for this GBR QoS Flow, e.g. due to Radio link failure
or RAN internal congestion).

NOTE 1: The current situation is either that the QoS Profile can be
fulfilled (which is implicitly indicated by the \"GFBR can be guaranteed
again\" notification itself), that a different Alternative QoS Profile
can be fulfilled, or that the lowest priority Alternative QoS Profile
cannot be fulfilled.

3)- The NG-RAN should always try to fulfil the QoS profile and, if this
is not possible, any Alternative QoS Profile that has higher priority.

NOTE 2: In order to avoid a too frequent signalling to the SMF, it is
assumed that NG-RAN implementation can apply hysteresis (e.g. via a
configurable time interval) before notifying the SMF that the currently
fulfilled values match the QoS Profile or a different Alternative QoS
Profile of higher priority. It is also assumed that the PCF has ensured
that the QoS values within the different Alternative QoS Profile(s) are
not too close to each other.

4\) Upon receiving a notification from the NG-RAN, the SMF may inform
the PCF. If it does so, the SMF shall indicate the currently fulfilled
situation to the PCF. See TS 23.503 \[45\].

5\) If the PCF has not indicated differently, the SMF uses NAS
signalling (that is sent transparently through the RAN) to inform the UE
about changes in the QoS parameters (i.e. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) that the
NG-RAN is currently fulfilling for the QoS Flow after Notification
control has occurred.

##### 5.7.2.4.2 Usage of Notification control with Alternative QoS Profiles at handover

During handover, the prioritized list of Alternative QoS Profile(s) (if
available) is provided to the Target NG-RAN per QoS Flow in addition to
the QoS profile. If the Target NG-RAN is not able to guarantee the GFBR,
the PDB and the PER included in the QoS profile and if Alternative QoS
Profiles are provided to the Target NG-RAN and the Target NG-RAN
supports Alternative QoS Profiles, the Target NG-RAN checks whether the
GFBR, the PDB and the PER values that it can fulfil match any of the
Alternative QoS Profile(s) taking the priority order into account. If
there is a match between one of the Alternative QoS Profiles and the
GFBR, the PDB and the PER values that Target NG-RAN can fulfil, the
Target NG-RAN shall accept the QoS Flow and indicate the reference to
that Alternative QoS Profile to the Source NG-RAN.

If there is no match to any Alternative QoS Profile, the Target NG-RAN
rejects QoS Flows for which the Target NG-RAN is not able to guarantee
the GFBR, the PDB and the PER included in the QoS profile.

After the handover is completed and a QoS Flow has been accepted by the
Target NG-RAN based on an Alternative QoS Profile, the Target NG-RAN
shall treat this QoS Flow in the same way as if it had sent a
notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" with a
reference to that Alternative QoS Profile to the SMF (as described in
clause 5.7.2.4.1b).

If a QoS Flow has been accepted by the Target NG-RAN based on an
Alternative QoS Profile, the reference to the matching Alternative QoS
Profile is provided from the Target NG-RAN to the AMF (which forwards
the message to the SMF) during the Xn and N2 based handover procedures
as described in TS 23.502 \[3\]. After the handover is completed
successfully, the SMF shall send a notification to the PCF that the
\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" for a QoS Flow (see
TS 23.503 \[45\] for details) if the SMF has received a reference to an
Alternative QoS Profile and this reference indicates a change in the
previously notified state of this QoS Flow. If the PCF has not indicated
differently, the SMF shall also use NAS signalling (that is sent
transparently through the RAN) to inform the UE about the QoS parameters
(i.e. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) corresponding to the new state of the QoS Flow.

NOTE: A state change for the QoS Flow comprises a change from QoS
profile fulfilled to Alternative QoS Profile fulfilled as well as the
state change between fulfilled Alternative QoS Profiles.

If a QoS Flow has been accepted by the Target NG-RAN based on the QoS
Profile, the SMF shall interpret the fact that a QoS Flow is listed as
transferred QoS Flow in the message received from the AMF as a
notification that \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\" for this QoS Flow.
After the handover is successfully completed, the Target NG-RAN performs
as described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b. If the SMF has previously notified
the PCF that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" and the SMF does
not receive an explicit notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be
guaranteed\" for that QoS Flow from the Target NG-RAN within a
configured time, the SMF shall notify the PCF that the \"GFBR can be
guaranteed again\".

If a QoS Flow has been accepted by the Target NG-RAN and SMF did not
receive from the Target NG-RAN a reference to any Alternative QoS
Profile and the SMF has previously informed the UE about QoS parameters
corresponding to any of the Alternative QoS Profile(s), the SMF shall
use NAS signalling to inform the UE about the QoS parameters
corresponding to the QoS Profile.

##### 5.7.2.4.3 Usage of Notification control with Alternative QoS Profiles during QoS Flow establishment and modification

During QoS Flow establishment and modification, a prioritized list of
Alternative QoS Profile(s) can be provided to the NG-RAN for the QoS
Flow in addition to the QoS profile. If the NG-RAN is not able to
guarantee the GFBR, the PDB and the PER included in the QoS profile and
if Alternative QoS Profiles are provided to the NG-RAN and the NG-RAN
supports Alternative QoS Profiles, the NG-RAN shall check whether the
GFBR, the PDB and the PER values that it can fulfil match at least one
of the Alternative QoS Profile(s) taking the priority order into
account. If there is a match between one of the Alternative QoS Profiles
and the GFBR, the PDB and the PER values that the NG-RAN can fulfil, the
NG-RAN shall accept the QoS Flow and indicate the reference to that
Alternative QoS Profile to the SMF. If there is no match to any
Alternative QoS Profile, the NG-RAN shall reject the QoS Flow
establishment or modification.

After a successful QoS Flow establishment or modification during which
the NG-RAN indicated that the currently fulfilled QoS matches one of the
Alternative QoS Profiles, the NG-RAN shall treat this QoS Flow in the
same way as if it had sent a notification that the \"GFBR can no longer
be guaranteed\" with a reference to that Alternative QoS Profile to the
SMF (as described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b).

If the SMF has received a reference to an Alternative QoS Profile during
QoS Flow establishment and modification the SMF may inform the PCF about
it (as described in TS 23.503 \[45\]).

If the PCF has not indicated differently, the SMF shall use NAS
signalling (that is sent transparently through the RAN) to inform the UE
about the QoS parameters (i.e. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) corresponding to the
referenced Alternative QoS Profile.

#### 5.7.2.5 Flow Bit Rates

For GBR QoS Flows only, the following additional QoS parameters exist:

\- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - UL and DL;

\- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) \-- UL and DL.

The GFBR denotes the bit rate that is guaranteed to be provided by the
network to the QoS Flow over the Averaging Time Window. The MFBR limits
the bit rate to the highest bit rate that is expected by the QoS Flow
(e.g. excess traffic may get discarded or delayed by a rate shaping or
policing function at the UE, RAN, UPF). Bit rates above the GFBR value
and up to the MFBR value, may be provided with relative priority
determined by the Priority Level of the QoS Flows (see clause 5.7.3.3).

GFBR and MFBR are signalled to the (R)AN in the QoS Profile and
signalled to the UE as QoS Flow level QoS parameter (as specified in
TS 24.501 \[47\]) for each individual QoS Flow.

NOTE 1: The GFBR is recommended as the lowest acceptable service bitrate
where the service will survive.

NOTE 2: For each QoS Flow of Delay-critical GBR resource type, the SMF
can ensure that the GFBR of the QoS Flow can be achieved with the MDBV
of the QoS Flow using the QoS Flow binding functionality described in
clause 6.1.3.2.4 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

NOTE 3: The network can set MFBR larger than GFBR for a particular QoS
Flow based on operator policy and the knowledge of the end point
capability, i.e. support of rate adaptation at application / service
level.

#### 5.7.2.6 Aggregate Bit Rates

Each PDU Session of a UE is associated with the following aggregate rate
limit QoS parameter:

\- per Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (Session-AMBR).

The Session-AMBR is signalled to the appropriate UPF entity/ies to the
UE and to the (R)AN (to enable the calculation of the UE-AMBR). The
Session-AMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be
provided across all Non-GBR QoS Flows for a specific PDU Session. The
Session-AMBR is measured over an AMBR averaging window which is a
standardized value. The Session-AMBR is not applicable to GBR QoS Flows.

Each UE is associated with the following aggregate rate limit QoS
parameter:

\- per UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (UE-AMBR).

The UE-AMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be
provided across all Non-GBR QoS Flows of a UE. Each (R)AN shall set its
UE-AMBR to the sum of the Session-AMBR of all PDU Sessions with active
user plane to this (R)AN up to the value of the UE-AMBR received from
AMF. The UE-AMBR is a parameter provided to the (R)AN by the AMF based
on the value of the subscribed UE-AMBR retrieved from UDM or the dynamic
serving network UE-AMBR retrieved from PCF (e.g. for roaming
subscriber). The AMF provides the UE-AMBR provided by PCF to (R)AN if
available. The UE-AMBR is measured over an AMBR averaging window which
is a standardized value. The UE-AMBR is not applicable to GBR QoS Flows.

Each group of PDU Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) may be
associated with the following aggregate rate limit QoS parameter:

\- per UE per Slice-Maximum Bit Rate (UE-Slice-MBR).

The UE-Slice-MBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to
be provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows corresponding to PDU
Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) which have an active
user plane. Each supporting RAN shall set its UE-Slice-MBR to the sum of
the Session-AMBR and MFBR for GBR QoS Flows of all PDU Sessions
corresponding to the slice (S-NSSAI) with active user plane to this RAN
up to the value of the UE-Slice-MBR corresponding to the slice (S-NSSAI)
received from AMF. The UE-Slice-MBR is measured over an AMBR averaging
window which is a standardized value. The UE-Slice-MBR is an optional
parameter provided to the RAN by the AMF as described in clause 5.15.13.

NOTE: The AMBR averaging window is only applied to Session-AMBR, UE-AMBR
and UE-Slice-MBR measurement and the AMBR averaging windows for
Session-AMBR and UE-AMBR are standardised to the same value.

#### 5.7.2.7 Default values

For each PDU Session Setup, the SMF retrieves the subscribed
Session-AMBR values as well as the subscribed default values for the 5QI
and the ARP and optionally, the 5QI Priority Level, from the UDM. The
subscribed default 5QI value shall be a Non-GBR 5QI from the
standardized value range.

NOTE 1: The 5QI Priority Level can be added to the subscription
information to achieve an overwriting of the standardized or
preconfigured 5QI Priority Level e.g. in scenarios where dynamic PCC is
not deployed or the PCF is unavailable or unreachable.

The SMF may change the subscribed values for the default 5QI and the ARP
and if received, the 5QI Priority Level, based on interaction with the
PCF as described in TS 23.503 \[45\] or, if dynamic PCC is not deployed,
based on local configuration, to set QoS parameters for the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule.

For QoS Flow(s) of the PDU Session other than the QoS Flow associated
with the default QoS rule, the SMF shall set the ARP priority level, the
ARP pre-emption capability and the ARP pre-emption vulnerability to the
respective values in the PCC rule(s) bound to that QoS Flow (as
described in TS 23.503 \[45\]). If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF
shall set the ARP priority level, the ARP pre-emption capability and the
ARP pre-emption vulnerability based on local configuration.

NOTE 2: The local configuration in the SMF can e.g. make use of the
subscribed value for the ARP priority level and apply locally configured
values for the ARP pre-emption capability and ARP pre-emption
vulnerability.

If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF can have a DNN based
configuration to enable the establishment of a GBR QoS Flow as the QoS
Flow that is associated with the default QoS rule. This configuration
contains a standardized GBR 5QI as well as GFBR and MFBR for UL and DL.

NOTE 3: Interworking with EPS is not possible for a PDU Session with a
GBR QoS Flow as the QoS Flow that is associated with the default QoS
rule.

The SMF may change the subscribed Session-AMBR values (for UL and/or
DL), based on interaction with the PCF as described in TS 23.503 \[45\]
or, if dynamic PCC is not deployed, based on local configuration, to set
the Session-AMBR values for the PDU Session.

#### 5.7.2.8 Maximum Packet Loss Rate

The Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL) indicates the maximum rate for
lost packets of the QoS Flow that can be tolerated in the uplink and
downlink direction. This is provided to the QoS Flow if it is compliant
to the GFBR

NOTE: In this Release of the specification, the Maximum Packet Loss Rate
(UL, DL) can only be provided for a GBR QoS Flow belonging to voice
media.

#### 5.7.2.9 Wireline access network specific 5G QoS parameters

QoS parameters that are applicable only for or wireline access networks
(W-5GAN) are specified in TS 23.316 \[84\].

### 5.7.3 5G QoS characteristics

#### 5.7.3.1 General

This clause specifies the 5G QoS characteristics associated with 5QI.
The characteristics describe the packet forwarding treatment that a QoS
Flow receives edge-to-edge between the UE and the UPF in terms of the
following performance characteristics:

1 Resource type (Non-GBR, GBR, Delay-critical GBR);

2 Priority Level;

3 Packet Delay Budget (including Core Network Packet Delay Budget);

4 Packet Error Rate;

5 Averaging window (for GBR and Delay-critical GBR resource type only);

6 Maximum Data Burst Volume (for Delay-critical GBR resource type only).

The 5G QoS characteristics should be understood as guidelines for
setting node specific parameters for each QoS Flow e.g. for 3GPP radio
access link layer protocol configurations.

Standardized or pre-configured 5G QoS characteristics, are indicated
through the 5QI value, and are not signalled on any interface, unless
certain 5G QoS characteristics are modified as specified in clauses
5.7.3.3, 5.7.3.4, 5.7.3.6, and 5.7.3.7.

NOTE: As there are no default values specified, pre-configured 5G QoS
characteristics have to include all of the characteristics listed above.

Signalled 5G QoS characteristics are provided as part of the QoS profile
and shall include all of the characteristics listed above.

#### 5.7.3.2 Resource Type

The resource type determines if dedicated network resources related to a
QoS Flow-level Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) value are permanently
allocated (e.g. by an admission control function in a radio base
station).

GBR QoS Flows are therefore typically authorized \"on demand\" which
requires dynamic policy and charging control. A GBR QoS Flow uses either
the GBR resource type or the Delay-critical GBR resource type. The
definition of PDB and PER are different for GBR and Delay-critical GBR
resource types, and the MDBV parameter applies only to the
Delay-critical GBR resource type.

A Non-GBR QoS Flow may be pre-authorized through static policy and
charging control. A Non-GBR QoS Flow uses only the Non-GBR resource
type.

#### 5.7.3.3 Priority Level

The Priority Level associated with 5G QoS characteristics indicates a
priority in scheduling resources among QoS Flows. The lowest Priority
Level value corresponds to the highest priority.

The Priority Level shall be used to differentiate between QoS Flows of
the same UE, and it shall also be used to differentiate between QoS
Flows from different UEs.

In the case of congestion, when all QoS requirements cannot be fulfilled
for one or more QoS Flows, the Priority Level shall be used to select
for which QoS Flows the QoS requirements are prioritised such that a QoS
Flow with Priority Level value N is priorized over QoS Flows with higher
Priority Level values (i.e. N+1, N+2, etc).In the case of no congestion,
the Priority Level should be used to define the resource distribution
between QoS Flows. In addition, the scheduler may prioritize QoS Flows
based on other parameters (e.g. resource type, radio condition) in order
to optimize application performance and network capacity.

Every standardized 5QI is associated with a default value for the
Priority Level -specified in QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4.1).
Priority Level may also be signalled together with a standardized 5QI to
the -R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the
default value.

Priority Level may also be signalled together with a pre-configured 5QI
to the (R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the
pre-configured value.

#### 5.7.3.4 Packet Delay Budget

The Packet Delay Budget (PDB) defines an upper bound for the time that a
packet may be delayed between the UE and the N6 termination point at the
UPF. The PDB applies to the DL packet received by the UPF over the N6
interface, and to the UL packet sent by the UE. For a certain 5QI the
value of the PDB is the same in UL and DL. In the case of 3GPP access,
the PDB is used to support the configuration of scheduling and link
layer functions (e.g. the setting of scheduling priority weights and
HARQ target operating points). For GBR QoS Flows using the
Delay-critical resource type, a packet delayed more than PDB is counted
as lost if the data burst is not exceeding the MDBV within the period of
PDB and the QoS Flow is not exceeding the GFBR. For GBR QoS Flows with
GBR resource type not exceeding GFBR, 98 percent of the packets shall
not experience a delay exceeding the 5QI\'s PDB.

The 5G Access Network Packet Delay Budget (5G-AN PDB) is determined by
subtracting a static value for the Core Network Packet Delay Budget (CN
PDB), which represents the delay between any N6 termination point at the
UPF (for any UPF that may possibly be selected for the PDU Session) and
the 5G-AN from a given PDB.

NOTE 1: For a standardized 5QI, the static value for the CN PDB is
specified in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1.

NOTE 2: For a non-standardized 5QI, the static value for the CN PDB is
homogeneously configured in the network.

For GBR QoS Flows using the Delay-critical resource type, in order to
obtain a more accurate delay budget PDB available for the NG-RAN, a
dynamic value for the CN PDB, which represents the delay between the UPF
terminating N6 for the QoS Flow and the 5G-AN, can be used. If used for
a QoS Flow, the NG-RAN shall apply the dynamic value for the CN PDB
instead of the static value for the CN PDB (which is only related to the
5QI). Different dynamic value for CN PDB may be configured per uplink
and downlink direction.

NOTE 3: The configuration of transport network on CN tunnel can be
different per UL and DL, which can be different value for CN PDB per UL
and DL.

NOTE 4: It is expected that the UPF deployment ensures that the dynamic
value for the CN PDB is not larger than the static value for the CN PDB.
This avoids that the functionality that is based on the 5G-AN PDB (e.g.
MDBV, NG-RAN scheduler) has to handle an unexpected value.

The dynamic value for the CN PDB of a Delay-critical GBR 5QI may be
configured in the network in two ways:

\- Configured in each NG-RAN node, based on a variety of inputs such as
different IP address(es) or TEID range of UPF terminating the N3 tunnel
and based on different combinations of PSA UPF to NG-RAN under
consideration of any potential I-UPF, etc;

\- Configured in the SMF, based on different combinations of PSA UPF to
NG-RAN under consideration of any potential I-UPF. The dynamic value for
the CN PDB for a particular QoS Flow shall be signalled to NG-RAN
(during PDU Session Establishment, PDU Session Modification, Xn/N2
handover and the Service Request procedures) when the QoS Flow is
established or the dynamic value for the CN PDB of a QoS Flow changes,
e.g. when an I-UPF is inserted by the SMF.

If the NG-RAN node is configured locally with a dynamic value for the CN
PDB for a Delay-critical GBR 5QI, and receives a different value via N2
signalling for a QoS Flow with the same 5QI, local configuration in RAN
node determines which value takes precedence.

Services using a GBR QoS Flow and sending at a rate smaller than or
equal to the GFBR can in general assume that congestion related packet
drops will not occur.

NOTE 5: Exceptions (e.g. transient link outages) can always occur in a
radio access system which may then lead to congestion related packet
drops. Packets surviving congestion related packet dropping may still be
subject to non-congestion related packet losses (see PER below).

Services using Non-GBR QoS Flows should be prepared to experience
congestion-related packet drops and delays. In uncongested scenarios, 98
percent of the packets should not experience a delay exceeding the
5QI\'s PDB.

The PDB for Non-GBR and GBR resource types denotes a \"soft upper
bound\" in the sense that an \"expired\" packet, e.g. a link layer SDU
that has exceeded the PDB, does not need to be discarded and is not
added to the PER. However, for a Delay-critical GBR resource type,
packets delayed more than the PDB are added to the PER and can be
discarded or delivered depending on local decision.

#### 5.7.3.5 Packet Error Rate

The Packet Error Rate (PER) defines an upper bound for the rate of PDUs
(e.g. IP packets) that have been processed by the sender of a link layer
protocol (e.g. RLC in RAN of a 3GPP access) but that are not
successfully delivered by the corresponding receiver to the upper layer
(e.g. PDCP in RAN of a 3GPP access). Thus, the PER defines an upper
bound for a rate of non-congestion related packet losses. The purpose of
the PER is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations
(e.g. RLC and HARQ in RAN of a 3GPP access). For every 5QI the value of
the PER is the same in UL and DL. For GBR QoS Flows with Delay-critical
GBR resource type, a packet which is delayed more than PDB is counted as
lost, and included in the PER unless the data burst is exceeding the
MDBV within the period of PDB or the QoS Flow is exceeding the GFBR.

#### 5.7.3.6 Averaging Window

Each GBR QoS Flow shall be associated with an Averaging window. The
Averaging window represents the duration over which the GFBR and MFBR
shall be calculated (e.g. in the (R)AN, UPF, UE).

Every standardized 5QI (of GBR and Delay-critical GBR resource type) is
associated with a default value for the Averaging window (specified in
QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4.1). The averaging window may also be
signalled together with a standardized 5QI to the (R)AN and UPF, and if
it is received, it shall be used instead of the default value.

The Averaging window may also be signalled together with a
pre-configured 5QI to the (R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used
instead of the pre-configured value.

#### 5.7.3.7 Maximum Data Burst Volume

Each GBR QoS Flow with Delay-critical resource type shall be associated
with a Maximum Data Burst Volume (MDBV).

MDBV denotes the largest amount of data that the 5G-AN is required to
serve within a period of 5G-AN PDB.

Every standardized 5QI (of Delay-critical GBR resource type) is
associated with a default value for the MDBV (specified in QoS
characteristics Table 5.7.4.1). The MDBV may also be signalled together
with a standardized 5QI to the (R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be
used instead of the default value.

The MDBV may also be signalled together with a pre-configured 5QI to the
(R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the
pre-configured value.

### 5.7.4 Standardized 5QI to QoS characteristics mapping

Standardized 5QI values are specified for services that are assumed to
be frequently used and thus benefit from optimized signalling by using
standardized QoS characteristics. Dynamically assigned 5QI values (which
require a signalling of QoS characteristics as part of the QoS profile)
can be used for services for which standardized 5QI values are not
defined. The one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS
characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1.

NOTE: It is preferred that a value less than 64 is allocated for any new
standardised 5QI of Non-GBR resource type. This is to allow for option 1
to be used as described in clause 5.7.1.3 (as the QFI is limited to less
than 64).

### 5.7.5 Reflective QoS

#### 5.7.5.1 General

Reflective QoS enables the UE to map UL User Plane traffic to QoS Flows
without SMF provided QoS rules and it applies for IP PDU Session and
Ethernet PDU Session. This is achieved by creating UE derived QoS rules
in the UE based on the received DL traffic. It shall be possible to
apply Reflective QoS and non-Reflective QoS concurrently within the same
PDU Session.

For a UE supporting Reflective QoS functionality, the UE shall create a
UE derived QoS rule for the uplink traffic based on the received DL
traffic if Reflective QoS function is used by the 5GC for some traffic
flows. The UE shall use the UE derived QoS rules to determine mapping of
UL traffic to QoS Flows.

If the 3GPP UE supports Reflective QoS functionality, the UE should
indicate support of Reflective QoS to the network (i.e. SMF) for every
PDU Session. For PDU Sessions established in EPS and PDU Sessions
transferred from EPS without N26 interface, the UE indicates Reflective
QoS support using the PDU Session Establishment procedure. After the
first inter-system change from EPS to 5GS for PDU Sessions established
in EPS and transferred from EPS with N26 interface, the UE indicates
Reflective QoS support using the PDU Session Modification procedure as
described in clause 5.17.2.2.2. The UE as well as the network shall
apply the information whether or not the UE indicated support of
Reflective QoS throughout the lifetime of the PDU Session.

NOTE: The logic driving a supporting UE under exceptional circumstances
to not indicate support of Reflective QoS for a PDU Session is
implementation dependent.

Under exceptional circumstances, which are UE implementation dependent,
the UE may decide to revoke previously indicated support for Reflective
QoS using the PDU Session Modification procedure. In such a case, the UE
shall delete all derived QoS rules for this PDU Session and the network
shall stop any user plane enforcement actions related to Reflective QoS
for this PDU Session. In addition, the network may provide signalled QoS
rules for the SDFs for which Reflective QoS was used before. The UE
shall not indicate support for Reflective QoS for this PDU Session for
the remaining lifetime of the PDU Session.

If under the same exceptional circumstances mentioned above and while
NAS level MM or SM congestion control timer is running, the UE needs to
revoke a previously indicated support for Reflective QoS, the UE
performs PDU Session Release procedure that is exempt from MM and SM
congestion control as defined in clause 5.19.7.

#### 5.7.5.2 UE Derived QoS Rule

The UE derived QoS rule contains following parameters:

\- One UL Packet Filter (in the Packet Filter Set as defined in
clause 5.7.6);

\- QFI;

\- Precedence value (see clause 5.7.1.9).

Upon receiving DL packet, one UL Packet Filter derived from the received
DL packet as described in this clause is used to identify a UE derived
QoS rule within a PDU Session.

For PDU Session of IP type, the UL Packet Filter is derived based on the
received DL packet as follows:

\- When Protocol ID / Next Header is set to TCP or UDP, by using the
source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port
numbers, and the Protocol ID / Next Header field itself.

\- When Protocol ID / Next Header is set to UDP, if the received DL
packet is UDP-encapsulated IPSec protected packet, by using the source
and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, the
Security Parameter Index, and the Protocol ID / Next Header field
itself. In this case, if an uplink IPSec SA corresponding to a downlink
IPSec SA of the SPI in the DL packet exists, then the UL Packet Filter
contains an SPI of the uplink IPSec SA.

\- When Protocol ID / Next Header is set to ESP, by using the source and
destination IP addresses, the Security Parameter Index, and the Protocol
ID / Next Header field itself. If the received DL packet is an IPSec
protected packet, and an uplink IPSec SA corresponding to a downlink
IPSec SA of the SPI in the DL packet exists, then the UL Packet Filter
contains an SPI of the uplink IPSec SA.

NOTE 1: In this Release of the specification for PDU Sessions of IP type
the use of Reflective QoS is restricted to service data flows for which
Protocol ID / Next Header is set to TCP, UDP or ESP.

NOTE 2: The UE does not verify whether the downlink packets with RQI
indication match the restrictions on Reflective QoS.

NOTE 3: How to determine the received DL packet is UDP-encapsulated
IPSec protected packet is defined in RFC 3948 \[138\]. UDP encapsulation
for ESP is used when a NAT is detected, and there can be different
Security Parameter Indexes within the same IP-tuples.

For PDU Session of Ethernet type the UL Packet Filter is derived based
on the received DL packet by using the source and destination MAC
addresses, the Ethertype on received DL packet is used as Ethertype for
UL packet. In the case of presence of 802.1Q \[98\], the VID and PCP in
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] header(s) of the received DL packet is also used
as the VID and PCP field for the UL Packet Filter. When double
802.1Q \[98\] tagging is used, only the outer (S-TAG) is taken into
account for the UL Packet Filter derivation.

NOTE 4: In this Release of the specification for PDU Sessions of
Ethernet type the use of Reflective QoS is restricted to service data
flows for which 802.1Q \[98\] tagging is used.

The QFI of the UE derived QoS rule is set to the value received in the
DL packet.

When Reflective QoS is activated the precedence value for all UE derived
QoS rules is set to a standardised value.

#### 5.7.5.3 Reflective QoS Control

Reflective QoS is controlled on per-packet basis by using the Reflective
QoS Indication (RQI) in the encapsulation header on N3 (and N9)
reference point together with the QFI and together with a Reflective QoS
Timer (RQ Timer) value that is either signalled to the UE upon PDU
Session Establishment (or upon PDU Session Modification as described in
clause 5.17.2.2.2) or set to a default value. The RQ Timer value
provided by the core network is at the granularity of PDU Session (the
details are specified in TS 24.501 \[47\]).

When the 5GC determines that Reflective QoS has to be used for a
specific SDF belonging to a QoS Flow, the SMF shall provide the RQA
(Reflective QoS Attribute) within the QoS Flow\'s QoS profile to the
NG-RAN on N2 reference point unless it has been done so before. When the
RQA has been provided to the NG-RAN for a QoS Flow and the 5GC
determines that the QoS Flow carries no more SDF for which Reflective
QoS has to be used, the SMF should signal the removal of the RQA
(Reflective QoS Attribute) from the QoS Flow\'s QoS profile to the
NG-RAN on N2 reference point.

NOTE 1: The SMF could have a timer to delay the sending of the removal
of the RQA. This would avoid signalling to the RAN in the case of new
SDFs subject to Reflective QoS are bound to this QoS Flow in the
meantime.

When the 5GC determines to use Reflective QoS for a specific SDF, the
SMF shall ensure that the UPF applies the RQI marking (e.g. by setting
the indication to use Reflective QoS in the QER associated with the DL
PDR if not already set) for this SDF. The SMF shall also ensure that the
uplink packets for this SDF can be received by the UPF from the QoS Flow
to which the DL PDR of the SDF is associated with as specified in
TS 29.244 \[65\], e.g. by generating a new UL PDR for this SDF for that
QoS Flow and providing it to the UPF.

When the UPF is instructed by the SMF to apply RQI marking, the UPF
shall set the RQI in the encapsulation header on the N3 (or N9)
reference point for every DL packet corresponding to this SDF.

When an RQI is received by (R)AN in a DL packet on N3 reference point,
the (R)AN shall indicate to the UE the QFI and the RQI of that DL
packet.

Upon reception of a DL packet with RQI:

\- if a UE derived QoS rule with a Packet Filter corresponding to the DL
packet does not already exist,

\- the UE shall create a new UE derived QoS rule with a Packet Filter
corresponding to the DL packet (as described in clause 5.7.5.2); and

\- the UE shall start, for this UE derived QoS rule, a timer set to the
RQ Timer value.

\- otherwise,

\- the UE shall restart the timer associated to this UE derived QoS
rule; and

\- if the QFI associated with the downlink packet is different from the
QFI associated with the UE derived QoS rule, the UE shall update this UE
derived QoS rule with the new QFI.

NOTE 2: Non-3GPP ANs does not need N2 signalling to enable Reflective
QoS. Non 3GPP accesses are expected to send transparently the QFI and
RQI to the UE. If the UPF does not include the RQI, no UE derived QoS
rule will be generated. If RQI is included to assist the UE to trigger
an update of the UE derived QoS rule, the reception of PDU for a QFI
restarts the RQ Timer.

Upon timer expiry associated with a UE derived QoS rule the UE deletes
the corresponding UE derived QoS rule.

When the 5GC determines not to use Reflective QoS for a specific SDF any
longer:

\- The SMF shall ensure that the UPF stops applying RQI marking as
specified in TS 29.244 \[65\] (e.g. by removing the indication to use
Reflective QoS from the QER associated with the DL PDR) for this SDF.

\- When the UPF receives this instruction to stop applying RQI marking,
the UPF shall no longer set the RQI in the encapsulation header on the
N3 (or N9) reference point DL packets corresponding to this SDF.

\- The SMF shall also ensure that, after an operator configurable time,
the uplink packets for this SDF will not be accepted by the UPF over the
QoS Flow on which Reflective QoS was applied for this SDF as specified
in TS 29.244 \[65\], e.g. by removing the UL PDR for this SDF from that
QoS Flow.

NOTE 3: The operator configurable time has to be at least as long as the
RQ Timer value to ensure that no UL packet would be dropped until the UE
derived QoS rule is deleted by the UE.

When the 5GC determines to change the binding of the SDF while
Reflective QoS is used for this SDF, the SMF shall ensure that the
uplink packets for this SDF are accepted over the newly bound QoS Flow
and, for an operator configurable time, over the previously bound QoS
Flow.

### 5.7.6 Packet Filter Set

#### 5.7.6.1 General

The Packet Filter Set is used in the QoS rule and the PDR to identify
one or more packet (IP or Ethernet) flow(s).

NOTE 1: A QoS Flow is characterised by PDR(s) and QoS rule(s) as
described in clause 5.7.1.1.

NOTE 2: DL Packet Filter in a Packet Filter Set of a QoS rule may be
needed by the UE e.g. for the purpose of IMS precondition.

The Packet Filter Set may contain one or more Packet Filter(s). Every
Packet Filter is applicable for the DL direction, the UL direction or
both directions.

NOTE 3: The Packet Filter in the Packet Filter Set of the default QoS
rule that allows all UL traffic (also known as match-all Packet Filter)
is described in TS 24.501 \[47\].

There are two types of Packet Filter Set, i.e. IP Packet Filter Set, and
Ethernet Packet Filter Set, corresponding to those PDU Session Types.

#### 5.7.6.2 IP Packet Filter Set

For IP PDU Session Type, the Packet Filter Set shall support Packet
Filters based on at least any combination of:

\- Source/destination IP address or IPv6 prefix.

\- Source / destination port number.

\- Protocol ID of the protocol above IP/Next header type.

\- Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask.

\- Flow Label (IPv6).

\- Security parameter index.

\- Packet Filter direction.

NOTE 1: A value left unspecified in a Packet Filter matches any value of
the corresponding information in a packet.

NOTE 2: An IP address or Prefix may be combined with a prefix mask.

NOTE 3: Port numbers may be specified as port ranges.

#### 5.7.6.3 Ethernet Packet Filter Set

For Ethernet PDU Session Type, the Packet Filter Set shall support
Packet Filters based on at least any combination of:

\- Source/destination MAC address.

\- Ethertype as defined in IEEE 802.3 \[131\].

\- Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) VID fields
as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\].

\- Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) PCP/DEI
fields as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\].

\- IP Packet Filter Set, in the case that Ethertype indicates IPv4/IPv6
payload.

\- Packet Filter direction.

NOTE 1: The MAC address may be specified as address ranges.

NOTE 2: A value left unspecified in a Packet Filter matches any value of
the corresponding information in a packet.

## 5.8 User Plane Management

### 5.8.1 General

User Plane Function(s) handle the user plane path of PDU Sessions. 3GPP
specifications support deployments with a single UPF or multiple UPFs
for a given PDU Session. UPF selection is performed by SMF. The details
of UPF selection is described in clause 6.3.3. The number of UPFs
supported for a PDU Session is unrestricted.

For an IPv4 type PDU Session or an IPv6 type PDU Session without
multi-homing or an IPv4v6 type PDU Session, when multiple PDU Session
Anchors are used (due to UL CL being inserted), only one IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix is allocated for the PDU Session. For an IPv6
multi-homed PDU Session there are multiple IPv6 prefixes allocated for
the PDU Session as described in clause 5.6.4.3.

If the SMF had requested the UPF to proxy ARP or IPv6 Neighbour
Solicitation for an Ethernet DNN, the UPF should respond to the ARP or
IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation Request, itself.

Deployments with one single UPF used to serve a PDU Session do not apply
to the Home Routed case and may not apply to the cases described in
clause 5.6.4.

Deployments where a UPF is controlled either by a single SMF or multiple
SMFs (for different PDU Sessions) are supported.

UPF traffic detection capabilities may be used by the SMF in order to
control at least following features of the UPF:

\- Traffic detection (e.g. classifying traffic of IP type, Ethernet
type, or unstructured type)

\- Traffic reporting (e.g. allowing SMF support for charging).

\- QoS enforcement (The corresponding requirements are defined in
clause 5.7).

\- Traffic routing (e.g. as defined in clause 5.6.4. for UL CL or IPv6
multi-homing).

### 5.8.2 Functional Description

#### 5.8.2.1 General

This clause contains detailed functional descriptions for some of the
functions provided by the UPF. It is described how the SMF instructs
it\'s corresponding UP function and which control parameters are used.

#### 5.8.2.2 UE IP Address Management

##### 5.8.2.2.1 General

The UE IP address management includes allocation and release of the UE
IP address as well as renewal of the allocated IP address, where
applicable.

\- If there is a matching URSP rule or a matching UE Local Configuration
containing a PDU Session Type of \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\", then
the UE shall set the requested PDU Session Type to the PDU Session Type
contained in the matching URSP rule or in the matching UE Local
Configuration, if this PDU Session Type is supported by the UE\'s IP
stack capabilities. If there is no PDU Session Type value in the
matching URSP rule or in the matching UE Local Configuration, the UE
shall not include the requested PDU Session Type in the PDU Session
Establishment Request message.

\- Otherwise, if there is no matching URSP rule and no matching UE Local
Configuration, the UE shall set the requested PDU Session Type during
the PDU Session Establishment procedure based on its IP stack
capabilities as follows:

\- A UE which supports IPv6 and IPv4 shall set the requested PDU Session
Type \"IPv4v6\".

\- A UE which supports only IPv4 shall request for PDU Session Type
\"IPv4\".

\- A UE which supports only IPv6 shall request for PDU Session Type
\"IPv6\".

\- When the IP version capability of the UE is unknown in the UE (as in
the case when the MT and TE are separated and the capability of the TE
is not known in the MT), the UE shall request for PDU Session Type
\"IPv4v6\".

The SMF selects PDU Session Type of the PDU Session as follows:

\- If the SMF receives a request with PDU Session Type set to
\"IPv4v6\", the SMF selects either PDU Session Type \"IPv4\" or \"IPv6\"
or \"IPv4v6\" based on DNN configuration, subscription data and operator
policies.

\- If the SMF receives a request for PDU Session Type \"IPv4\" or
\"IPv6\" and the requested IP version is supported by the DNN the SMF
selects the requested PDU Session type.

In its answer to the UE, the SMF may indicate the PDU Session Types not
allowed for the combination of (DNN, S-NNSAI). In this case, the UE
shall not request another PDU Session to the same (DNN, S-NNSAI) for PDU
Session Types indicated as not allowed by the network. In the case that
the initial PDU Session was established with a PDU Session Type and the
UE needs another single IP version PDU Session Type, the UE may initiate
another PDU Session Establishment procedure to this (DNN, S-NNSAI) in
order to activate a second PDU session with that PDU Session Type.

An SMF shall ensure that the IP address management procedure is based on
the selected PDU Session Type. If IPv4 PDU Session Type is selected, an
IPv4 address is allocated to the UE. Similarly, if IPv6 PDU Session type
is selected, an IPv6 prefix is allocated. If IPv4v6 PDU Session Type is
selected, both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix are allocated. For
Roaming case, the SMF in this clause refers to the SMF controlling the
UPF(s) acting as PDU Session Anchor. i.e. H-SMF in home routed case and
V-SMF in local breakout case. For home routed case, V-SMF forwards the
PDU Session Type requested by UE to H-SMF without interpreting it. V-SMF
sends back to UE the PDU Session Type selected by H-SMF. The SMF shall
process the UE IP address management related messages, maintain the
corresponding state information and provide the response messages to the
UE.

The 5GC and UE support the following mechanisms:

a\. During PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF sends the IP
address to the UE via SM NAS signalling. The IPv4 address allocation
and/or IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4 (according to
RFC 2131 \[9\]) can also be used once PDU Session is established.

b\. /64 IPv6 prefix allocation shall be supported via IPv6 Stateless
Auto-configuration according to RFC 4862 \[10\], if IPv6 is supported.
The details of Stateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration are described in
clause 5.8.2.2.3. IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6
(according to RFC 3736 \[14\]) may also be supported.

For scenarios with RG connecting to 5GC, additional features for IPv6
address allocation and IPv6 prefix delegation are supported, as
described in TS 23.316 \[84\].

To allocate the IP address via DHCPv4, the UE may indicate to the
network within the Protocol Configuration Options that the UE requests
to obtain the IPv4 address with DHCPv4, or obtain the IP address during
the PDU Session Establishment procedure. This implies the following
behaviour both for static and dynamic address allocation:

\- The UE may indicate that it requests to obtain an IPv4 address as
part of the PDU Session Establishment procedure. In such a case, the UE
relies on the 5GC network to provide IPv4 address to the UE as part of
the PDU Session Establishment procedure.

\- The UE may indicate that it requests to obtain the IPv4 address after
the PDU Session Establishment procedure by DHCPv4. That is, when the 5GC
network supports DHCPv4 and allows that, it does not provide the IPv4
address for the UE as part of the PDU Session Establishment procedure.
The network may respond to the UE by setting the allocated IPv4 Address
to 0.0.0.0. After the PDU Session Establishment procedure is completed,
the UE uses the connectivity with the 5GC and initiates the IPv4 address
allocation on its own using DHCPv4. However, if the 5GC network provides
IPv4 address to the UE as part of the PDU Session Establishment
procedure, the UE should accept the IPv4 address indicated in the PDU
Session Establishment procedure.

\- If the UE sends no IP Address Allocation request, the SMF determines
whether DHCPv4 is used between the UE and the SMF or not, based on per
DNN configuration.

If dynamic policy provisioning is deployed, and the PCF was not informed
of the IPv4 address at PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF
shall inform the PCF about an allocated IPv4 address. If the IPv4
address is released, the SMF shall inform the PCF about the
de-allocation of an IPv4 address.

In order to support DHCP based IP address configuration, the SMF shall
act as the DHCP server towards the UE. The PDU Session Anchor UPF does
not have any related DHCP functionality. The SMF instructs the PDU
Session Anchor UPF serving the PDU Session to forward DHCP packets
between the UE and the SMF over the user plane.

When DHCP is used for external data network assigned addressing and
parameter configuration, the SMF shall act as the DHCP client towards
the external DHCP server. The UPF does not have any related DHCP
functionality. In the case of DHCP server on the external data network,
the SMF instructs a UPF with N6 connectivity to forward DHCP packets
between the UE and the SMF and the external DHCP server over the user
plane.

The 5GC may also support the allocation of a static IPv4 address and/or
a static IPv6 prefix based on subscription information in the UDM or
based on the configuration on a per-subscriber, per-DNN basis and
per-S-NSSAI.

If the static IP address/prefix is stored in the UDM, during PDU Session
Establishment procedure, the SMF retrieves this static IP address/prefix
from the UDM. If the static IP address/prefix is not stored in the UDM
subscription record, it may be configured on a per-subscriber, per-DNN
and per-S-NSSAI basis in the DHCP/DN-AAA server and the SMF retrieves
the IP address/prefix for the UE from the DHCP/DN-AAA server. This IP
address/prefix is delivered to the UE in the same way as a dynamic IP
address/prefix. It is transparent to the UE whether the PLMN or the
external data network allocates the IP address and whether the IP
address is static or dynamic.

For IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU Session Type, during PDU Session
Establishment procedure, the SMF may receive a Subscriber\'s IP Index
from the UDM. If the UE IP address/prefix was not already allocated and
provided to PCF when SMF initiates the SM policy association, the SMF
may receive a Subscribers IP Index from the PCF. If the SMF received a
Subscriber\'s IP index from both UDM and PCF, the SMF shall apply the
Subscriber\'s IP Index received from the PCF. The SMF may use the
Subscriber\'s IP Index to assist in selecting how the IP address is to
be allocated when multiple allocation methods, or multiple instances of
the same method are supported. In the case of Home Routed roaming, the
H-SMF may receive the IP index from the H-PCF.

NOTE: The IP Index can e.g. be used to select between different IP
pools, including between IP pools with overlapping private address
range. To support deployments with overlapping private IPv4 address, the
IP domain corresponding to IP index can also be provided from UDM to SMF
as part of the subscription data and then provided to PCF.

When Static IP addresses for a PDU session are not used, the actual
allocation of the IP Address(es) for a PDU Session may use any of the
following mechanisms:

\- The SMF allocates the IP address from a pool that corresponds to the
PDU Session Anchor (UPF) that has been selected

\- The UE IP address is obtained from the UPF. In that case the SMF
shall interact with the UPF via N4 procedures to obtain a suitable IP
address. The SMF provides the UPF with the necessary information
allowing the UPF to derive the proper IP address (e.g. the network
instance).

\- In the case that the UE IP address is obtained from the external data
network, additionally, the SMF shall also send the allocation, renewal
and release related request messages to the external data network, i.e.
DHCP/DN-AAA server, and maintain the corresponding state information.
The IP address allocation request sent to DHCP/DN-AAA server may include
the IP address pool ID to identify which range of IP address is to be
allocated. In this case the SMF is provisioned with separate IP address
pool ID(s), and the mapping between IP address pool ID and UPF Id, DNN,
S-NSSAI, IP version. The provision is done by OAM or during the N4
Association Setup procedure.

A given IP address pool is controlled by a unique entity (either the SMF
or the UPF or an external server). The IP address managed by the UPF can
be partitioned into multiple IP address pool partition(s), i.e.
associated with multiple IP address pool ID(s).

When the SMF is configured to obtain UE IP addresses from the UPF, the
SMF may select a UPF based upon support of this feature. The SMF
determines whether the UPF supports this feature via NRF or via N4
capability negotiation during N4 Association Setup. If no appropriate
UPF support the feature, the SMF may allocate UE IP addresses, if
configured to do so.

The IP address/prefix is released by the SMF (e.g. upon release of the
PDU Session), likewise the UPF considers that any IP address it has
allocated within a N4 session are released when this N4 session is
released.

##### 5.8.2.2.2 Routing rules configuration

When the UE has an IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session the UE selects the
source IPv6 prefix according to IPv6 multi-homed routing rules
pre-configured in the UE or received from network. IPv6 multi-homed
routing rules received from the network have a higher priority than IPv6
multi-homed routing rules pre-configured in the UE

The SMF can generate the IPv6 multi-homed routing rules for a UE based
on local configuration or dynamic PCC rules received from the PCF as
defined in TS 23.503 \[45\]. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the SMF
generates the IPv6 multi-home routing rules for a source IPv6 prefix
based on the SDF Templates of those PCC rules which contain the DNAI
corresponding to the newly assigned IPv6 prefix. The SMF can send IPv6
multi-homed routing rules to the UE to influence the source IPv6 prefix
selection in IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages according to
RFC 4191 \[8\] at any time during the lifetime of the IPv6 multi-homed
PDU Session. Such messages are sent via the UPF.

NOTE: For multiple IPv4 PDU Session and multiple IPv6 PDU Session cases,
routing rule based PDU Session selection is not specified in this
Release of the specification.

##### 5.8.2.2.3 The procedure of Stateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration

If Stateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration is used for IPv6 address
allocation to the UE, after PDU Session Establishment the UE may send a
Router Solicitation message to the SMF to solicit a Router Advertisement
message. The SMF sends a Router Advertisement message (solicited or
unsolicited) to the UE. The Router Advertisement messages shall contain
the IPv6 prefix.

After the UE has received the Router Advertisement message, it
constructs a full IPv6 address via IPv6 Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration in accordance with RFC 4862 \[10\]. To ensure that the
link-local address generated by the UE does not collide with the
link-local address of the UPF and the SMF, the SMF shall provide an
interface identifier (see RFC 4862 \[10\]) to the UE and the UE shall
use this interface identifier to configure its link-local address. For
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration however, the UE can choose any
interface identifier to generate IPv6 addresses, other than link-local,
without involving the network. However, the UE shall not use any
identifiers defined in TS 23.003 \[19\] as the basis for generating the
interface identifier. For privacy, the UE may change the interface
identifier used to generate full IPv6 address, as defined in
TS 23.221 \[23\] without involving the network. Any prefix that the SMF
advertises to the UE is globally unique. The SMF shall also record the
relationship between the UE\'s identity (SUPI) and the allocated IPv6
prefix. Because any prefix that the SMF advertises to the UE is globally
unique, there is no need for the UE to perform Duplicate Address
Detection for any IPv6 address configured from the allocated IPv6
prefix. Even if the UE does not need to use Neighbor Solicitation
messages for Duplicate Address Detection, the UE may, for example, use
them to perform Neighbor Unreachability Detection towards the SMF, as
defined in RFC 4861 \[54\]. Therefore, the SMF shall respond with a
Neighbor Advertisement upon receiving a Neighbor Solicitation message
from the UE.

In IPv6 multi-homing PDU session, SMF shall not allocate an interface
identifier when a new IPv6 prefix allocated corresponding to the new PDU
Session Anchor.

The above IPv6 related messages (e.g. Router Solicitation, Router
Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement) are
transferred between the SMF and UE via the UPF(s). If the Control Plane
CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for a PDU session, the above IPv6
related messages are transferred between the SMF and UE via the AMF
after PDU Session Establishment, see clauses 4.3.2.2.1 and 4.3.2.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\], using the Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation procedures.

#### 5.8.2.3 Management of CN Tunnel Info

##### 5.8.2.3.1 General

CN Tunnel Info is the Core Network address of a N3/N9 tunnel
corresponding to the PDU Session. It comprises the TEID and the IP
address which is used by the UPF on the N3/N9 tunnel for the PDU
Session.

The CN Tunnel Info allocation and release is performed by the UPF. The
SMF shall indicate to the UPF when the UPF is required to
allocate/release CN Tunnel Info.

##### 5.8.2.3.2 Void

##### 5.8.2.3.3 Management of CN Tunnel Info in the UPF

The UPF shall manage the CN Tunnel Info space. When a new CN Tunnel Info
is needed, the SMF shall request over N4 the UPF to allocate CN Tunnel
Info for the applicable N3/N9 reference point. In response, the UPF
provides CN Tunnel Info to the SMF. In the case of PDU Session Release
or a UPF is removed from the user plane path of an existing PDU Session,
the SMF shall request UPF to release CN Tunnel Info for the PDU Session.
If the corresponding N4 Session is released the UPF releases the
associated CN Tunnel Info.

#### 5.8.2.4 Traffic Detection

##### 5.8.2.4.1 General

This clause describes the detection process at the UPF that identifies
the packets belonging to a session, or a service data flow.

The SMF is responsible for instructing the UP function about how to
detect user data traffic belonging to a Packet Detection Rule (PDR). The
other parameters provided within a PDR describe how the UP function
shall treat a packet that matches the detection information.

##### 5.8.2.4.2 Traffic Detection Information

The SMF controls the traffic detection at the UP function by providing
detection information for every PDR.

For IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU Session type, detection information is a
combination of:

\- CN tunnel info.

\- Network instance.

\- QFI.

\- IP Packet Filter Set as defined in clause 5.7.6.2.

\- Application Identifier: The Application Identifier is an index to a
set of application detection rules configured in UPF.

For Ethernet PDU Session type, detection information is a combination
of:

\- CN tunnel info.

\- Network instance.

\- QFI.

\- Ethernet Packet Filter Set as defined in clause 5.7.6.3.

In this Release of the specification for Unstructured PDU Session Type,
the UPF does not perform-QoS Flow level traffic detection for QoS
enforcement.

Traffic detection information sent by the SMF to the UPF for a PDU
Session may be associated with Network instance for detection and
routing of traffic over N6. In the case of IP PDU Session Type, Network
Instances can e.g. be used by the UPF for traffic detection and routing
in the case of different IP domains or overlapping IP addresses. In the
case of Ethernet PDU Session Type, different Network Instances can e.g.
be configured in the UPF with different ways to handle the association
between N6 and the PDU Sessions.

#### 5.8.2.5 Control of User Plane Forwarding

##### 5.8.2.5.1 General

The SMF controls user-plane packet forwarding for traffic detected by a
PDR by providing a FAR with instructions to the UPF, including:

\- Forwarding operation information;

\- Forwarding target information.

The details of the forwarding target and operation will depend on the
scenario and is described below. The following forwarding functionality
is required by the UPF:

\- Apply N3 /N9 tunnel related handling, i.e. encapsulation.

\- Forward the traffic to/from the SMF, e.g. as described in Table
5.8.2.5.2-1.

\- Forward the SM PDU DN Request Container from SMF to DN-AAA server

\- Forward the traffic according to locally configured policy for
traffic steering.

\- Forward the traffic according to N4 rules of a 5G VN group for 5G VN
group communication.

\- Forward the traffic to/from the EASDF.

Data forwarding between the SMF and UPF is transmitted on the user plane
tunnel established on N4 interface, defined in TS 29.244 \[65\].

##### 5.8.2.5.2 Data forwarding between the SMF and UPF

Scenarios for data forwarding between the SMF and UPF are defined as
below:

Table 5.8.2.5.2-1: Scenarios for data forwarding between the SMF and UPF

+----+------------------------------+---------------------------------+

##### 5.8.2.5.3 Support of Ethernet PDU Session type

When configuring an UPF acting as PSA for an Ethernet PDU Session Type,
the SMF may instruct the UPF to route the traffic based on detected MAC
addresses as follows.

\- The UPF learns the MAC address(es) connected via N6 based on the
source MAC addresses of the DL traffic received on a N6 Network
Instance.

\- The UPF learns the MAC address(es) of UE(s) and devices connected
behind, if any, based on the source MAC address contained within the UL
traffic received on a PDU Session (N3/N9 interface).

\- The UPF forwards DL unicast traffic (with a known destination
address) on a PDU Session determined based on the source MAC address(es)
used by the UE for the UL traffic.

\- The UPF forwards UL unicast traffic (with a known destination
address) on a port (PDU Session or N6 interface) determined based on the
source MAC address(es) learned beforehand.

\- In the case of multicast and broadcast traffic (if the destination
MAC address is a broadcast or multicast address):

\- for DL traffic received by UPF on a N6 Network Instance the UPF
should forward the traffic to every DL PDU Session (corresponding to any
N4 Session) associated with this Network Instance

\- for uplink traffic received by UPF over a PDU session on a N3/N9
interface, the UPF should forward the traffic to the N6 interface and
downlink to every PDU session (except toward the one of the incoming
traffic) associated with the same N6 Network Instance

\- for uplink and downlink unicast traffic received by UPF, if the
destination MAC has not been learnt, the UPF should forward the traffic
to every PDU session associated with the same N6 Network Instance and
towards the N6 interface. In any case the traffic is not replicated on
the PDU Session or the N6 interface of the incoming traffic.

NOTE 1: The UPF can consider a PDU Session or a N6 interface to be
active or inactive in order to avoid forwarding loops. User data traffic
is not sent on inactive PDU sessions or inactive N6 interface. This
release of the specification does not further specify how the UPF
determines whether a PDU Session or N6 interface is considered active or
inactive.

NOTE 2: This release of the specification supports only a single N6
interface in a UPF associated with the N6 Network Instance.

\- if the traffic is received with a VLAN ID, the above criteria apply
only towards the N6 interface or PDU session matching the same VLAN ID,
unless the UPF is instructed to remove the VLAN ID in the incoming
traffic.

NOTE 3: This release of the specification supports Independent VLAN
Learning (IVL) and does not support Shared VLAN Learning (SVL), as
described in IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\].

\- if the destination MAC address of traffic refers to the same N6
interface or PDU session on which the traffic has been received, the
frame shall be dropped.

In order to handle scenarios where a device behind a UE is moved from a
source UE to a target UE, a MAC address is considered as no longer
associated with a UPF interface (source UE\'s PDU session) when the MAC
address has not been detected as Source MAC address in UL traffic for a
pre-defined period of time or the MAC address has been detected under a
different interface (target UE\'s PDU Session or N6).

NOTE 4: The UPF/NW-TT may also be provided with static filtering entries
as described in clause 5.28.3. How the UPF uses the static filtering
entry to achieve forwarding of Ethernet frames to one or more egress
ports is up to UPF implementation. The externally observable behaviour
of 5GS Bridge needs to comply with IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\].

For ARP/IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation traffic, a SMF\'s request to respond
to ARP/IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation based on local cache information or
to redirect such traffic from the UPF to the SMF overrules the traffic
forwarding rules described above.

NOTE 5: Local policies in UPF associated with the Network Instance can
prevent local traffic switching in the UPF between PDU Sessions either
for unicast traffic only or for any traffic. In the case where UPF
policies prevent local traffic switching for any traffic (thus for
broadcast/multicast traffic) some mechanism such as responding to ARP/ND
based on local cache information or local multicast group handling is
needed to ensure that upper layer protocol can run on the Ethernet PDU
sessions.

The SMF may ask to get notified with the source MAC addresses used by
the UE, e.g. if the PCF has subscribed to UE MAC address change
notifications, as described in TS 23.503 \[45\].

In order to request the UPF to act as defined above, the SMF may, for
each PDU Session corresponding to a Network Instance, set an Ethernet
PDU Session Information in a DL PDR that identifies all (DL) Ethernet
packets matching the PDU session. Alternatively, for unicast traffic the
SMF may provide UPF with dedicated forwarding rules related with MAC
addresses notified by the UPF.

#### 5.8.2.6 Charging and Usage Monitoring Handling

##### 5.8.2.6.1 General

The SMF shall support interfaces towards CHF and PCF. The SMF interacts
with CHF and PCF based on information received from other control plane
NFs and user plane related information received from the UPF.

QoS Flow level, PDU Session level and subscriber related information
remain at the SMF, and only usage information is requested from the UPF.

##### 5.8.2.6.2 Activation of Usage Reporting in UPF

Triggered by the PCC rules received from the PCF or preconfigured
information available at SMF, as well as from the CHF for online
charging method via quota management mechanisms, the SMF shall provide
Usage Reporting Rules to the UPF for controlling how usage reporting is
performed.

The SMF shall request the report of the relevant usage information for
Usage Monitoring, based on Monitoring Keys and triggers which are
specified in TS 23.503 \[45\]. Each Usage Reporting Rule requested for
usage monitoring control is associated with the PDR(s) whose traffic is
to be accounted under this rule. The SMF shall generate the Usage
Reporting Rule for each Monitoring-key within the active PCC Rule(s),
either preconfigured or received from the PCF and also shall keep the
mapping between them. Multiple Usage Reporting Rules may be associated
with the same PDR.

The SMF shall request the report of the relevant usage information for
offline and online charging, based on Charging keys and additional
triggers which are specified in TS 32.255 \[68\]. Each Usage Reporting
Rule requested for offline or online charging is associated with the
PDR(s) whose traffic is to be accounted under this rule. The SMF shall
generate the Usage Reporting Rule for each Charging key and Sponsor
Identity (if applicable) within the active PCC Rule(s), either
preconfigured or received from the PCF, and also shall keep the mapping
between them. Multiple Usage Reporting Rules may be associated with the
same PDR.

The SMF function shall also provide reporting trigger events to the UPF
for when to report usage information. The reporting trigger events (e.g.
triggers, threshold information etc.) shall be supported for the PDU
Session level reporting as well as on Rule level basis as determined by
the SMF. The triggers may be provided as a volume, time or event to
cater for the different charging/usage monitoring models supported by
the TS 23.503 \[45\] for usage monitoring and by TS 32.255 \[68\] for
converged offline and online charging. The SMF shall decide on the
thresholds value(s) based on allowance received from PCF, CHF or based
on local configuration. Other parameters for instructing the UPF to
report usage information are defined in TS 29.244 \[65\].

When the PCC Rule attribute Service Data flow handling while requesting
credit (specified in TS 23.503 \[45\]) indicates \"non-blocking\", the
SMF shall request the report of the relevant usage information for the
Charging key and Sponsor Identity (if applicable) and provide a default
threshold value to the UPF while waiting for the quota from the CHF.

In some cases, the same Usage Reporting Rule can be used for different
purposes (for both usage monitoring and charging), e.g. in the case that
the same set of PDR(s), measurement method, trigger event, threshold,
etc. apply. Similarly a reported measurement can be used for different
purposes by the SMF.

##### 5.8.2.6.3 Reporting of Usage Information towards SMF

The UPF shall support reporting of usage information to the SMF. The UPF
shall be capable to support reporting based on different triggers,
including:

\- Periodic reporting with period defined by the SMF.

\- Usage thresholds provided by the SMF.

\- Report on demand received from the SMF.

The SMF shall make sure that the multiple granularity levels required by
the reporting keys in the Usage Reporting rules satisfy the following
aggregation levels without requiring a knowledge of the granularity
levels by the UPF:

\- PDU Session level reporting;

\- Traffic flow (for both charging and usage monitoring) level reporting
as defined by the reporting keys in the Usage Reporting Rule (see the
description above).

Based on the mapping between Monitoring key and PCC rule stored at the
SMF, the SMF shall combine the reported information with session and
subscriber related information which is available at the SMF, for Usage
Monitoring reporting over the corresponding Npcf interface (N7 reference
point).

Based on the mapping between Charging key and Sponsor Identity (if
applicable) and PCC rule stored at the SMF, the SMF shall combine the
reported information with session and subscriber related information
which is available at the SMF, for offline and online charging reporting
over the corresponding charging interfaces.

This functionality is specified in TS 32.255 \[68\].

The usage information shall be collected in the UPF and reported to the
SMF as defined in 5.8.2.6, based on Monitoring Keys and triggers which
are specified in TS 23.503 \[45\].

#### 5.8.2.7 PDU Session and QoS Flow Policing

ARP is used for admission control (i.e. retention and pre-emption of the
new QoS Flow). The value of ARP is not required to be provided to the
UPF.

For every QoS Flow, the SMF shall determine the transport level packet
marking value (e.g. the DSCP in the outer IP header) based on the 5QI,
the Priority Level (if explicitly signalled) and optionally, the ARP
priority level and provide the transport level packet marking value to
the UPF.

The SMF shall provide the Session-AMBR values of the PDU Session to the
UPF so that the UPF can enforce the Session-AMBR of the PDU Session
across all Non-GBR QoS Flows of the PDU Session.

SMF shall provide the GFBR and MFBR value for each GBR QoS Flow of the
PDU Session to the UPF. SMF may also provide the Averaging window to the
UPF, if Averaging window is not configured at the UPF or if it is
different from the default value configured at the UPF.

#### 5.8.2.8 PCC Related Functions

##### 5.8.2.8.1 Activation/Deactivation of predefined PCC rules

A predefined PCC rule is configured in the SMF.

The traffic detection filters, e.g. IP Packet Filter, required in the UP
function can be configured either in the SMF and provided to the UPF, as
service data flow filter(s), or be configured in the UPF, as the
application detection filter identified by an application identifier.
For the latter case, the application identifier has to be configured in
the SMF and the UPF.

The traffic steering policy information can be only configured in the
UPF, together with traffic steering policy identifier(s), while the SMF
has to be configured with the traffic steering policy identifier(s).

Policies for traffic handling in the UPF, which are referred by some
identifiers corresponding to the parameters of a PCC rule, can be
configured in the UPF. These traffic handling policies are configured as
predefined QER(s), FAR(s) and URR(s).

When a predefined PCC rule is activated/deactivated by the PCF, SMF
shall decide what information has to be provided to the UPF to enforce
the rule based on where the traffic detection filters (i.e. service data
flow filter(s) or application detection filter), traffic steering policy
information and the policies used for the traffic handling in the UPF
are configured and where they are enforced:

\- If the predefined PCC rule contains an application identifier for
which corresponding application detection filters are configured in the
UPF, the SMF shall provide a corresponding application identifier to the
UPF;

\- If the predefined PCC rule contains traffic steering policy
identifier(s), the SMF shall provide a corresponding traffic steering
policy identifier(s) to the UPF;

\- If the predefined PCC rule contains service data flow filter(s), the
SMF shall provide them to the UPF;

\- If the predefined PCC rule contains some parameters for which
corresponding policies for traffic handling in the UPF are configured in
the UPF, the SMF shall activate those traffic handling policies via
their rule ID(s).

The SMF shall maintain the mapping between a PCC rule received over Npcf
and the flow level PDR rule(s) used on N4 interface.

##### 5.8.2.8.2 Enforcement of Dynamic PCC Rules

The application detection filters required in the UPF can be configured
either in the SMF and provided to the UPF as the service data flow
filter, or be configured in the UP function identified by an application
identifier.

When receiving a dynamic PCC rule from the PCF which contains an
application identifier and/or parameters for traffic handling in the
UPF:

\- if the application detection filter is configured in the SMF, the SMF
shall provide it in the service data flow filter to the UPF, as well as
parameters for traffic handling in the UPF received from the dynamic PCC
rule;

\- otherwise, the application detection filters is configured in UPF,
the SMF shall provide to UPF with the application identifier and the
parameters for traffic handling in the UPF as required based on the
dynamic PCC rule.

The SMF shall maintain the mapping between a PCC rule received over Npcf
and the flow level PDR(s) used on N4 interface.

##### 5.8.2.8.3 Redirection

The uplink application\'s traffic redirection may be enforced either in
the SMF (as specified in 5.8.2.5 Control of user plane forwarding) or
directly in the UPF. The redirect destination may be provided in the
dynamic PCC rule or be preconfigured, either in the SMF or in the UPF.

When receiving redirect information (redirection enabled/disabled and
redirect destination) within a dynamic PCC rule or being
activated/deactivated by the PCF for the predefined redirection
policies, SMF shall decide whether to provide and what information to be
provided to the UPF based on where the redirection is enforced and where
the redirect destination is acquired/preconfigured. When redirection is
enforced in the UPF and the redirect destination is acquired from the
dynamic PCC rule or is configured in the SMF, SMF shall provide the
redirect destination to the UPF. When redirection is enforced in the
SMF, SMF shall instruct the UPF to forward applicable user plane traffic
to the SMF.

##### 5.8.2.8.4 Support of PFD Management

The NEF (PFDF) shall provide PFD(s) to the SMF on the request of SMF
(pull mode) or on the request of PFD management from NEF (push mode), as
described in TS 23.503 \[45\]. The SMF shall provide the PFD(s) to the
UPF, which have active PDR(s) with the application identifier
corresponding to the PFD(s).

The SMF supports the procedures in clause 4.4.3.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\],
for management of PFDs. PFD(s) is cached in the SMF, and the SMF
maintains a caching timer associated to the PFD(s). When the caching
timer expires and there\'s no active PCC rule that refers to the
corresponding application identifier, the SMF informs the UPF to remove
the PFD(s) identified by the application identifier using the PFD
management message.

When a PDR is provided for an application identifier corresponding to
the PFD(s) that are not already provided to the UPF, the SMF shall
provide the PFD(s) to the UPF (if there are no PFD(s) cached, the SMF
retrieves them from the NEF (PFDF) as specified in TS 23.503 \[45\]).
When any update of the PFD(s) is received from NEF (PFDF) by SMF (using
\"push\" or \"pull\" mode), and there are still active PDRs in UPF for
the application identifier, the SMF shall provision the updated PFD set
corresponding to the application identifier to the UPF using the PFD
management message.

NOTE 1: SMF can assure not to overload N4 signalling while managing
PFD(s) to the UPF, e.g. forwarding the PFD(s) to the right UPF where the
PFD(s) is enforced.

When the UPF receives the updated PFD(s) from either the same or
different SMF for the same application identifier, the latest received
PFD(s) shall overwrite any existing PFD(s) stored in the UPF.

NOTE 2: For the case a single UPF is controlled by multiple SMFs, the
conflict of PFD(s) corresponding to the same application identifier
provided by different SMF can be avoided by operator enforcing a
well-planned NEF (PFDF) and SMF/UPF deployment.

When a PFD is removed/modified and this PFD was used to detect
application traffic related to an application identifier in a PDR of an
N4 session and the UPF has reported the application start to the SMF as
defined in clause 4.4.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] for the application
instance corresponding to this PFD, the UPF shall report the application
stop to the SMF for the corresponding application instance identifier if
the removed/modified PFD in UPF results in that the stop of the
application instance is not being able to be detected.

If the PFDs are managed by local O&M procedures, PFD retrieval is not
used; otherwise, the PFDs retrieved from NEF (PFDF) override any PFDs
pre-configured in the SMF. When all the PFDs retrieved from the NEF
(PFDF) for an application identifier are removed, the pre-configured
PFDs are used. The SMF shall provide either the PFDs retrieved from NEF
(PFDF) or the pre-configured PFDs for an application identifier to the
UPF.

#### 5.8.2.9 Functionality of Sending of \"End marker\"

##### 5.8.2.9.0 Introduction

Sending of \"end marker\" is a functionality which involve SMF and UPF
in order to assist the reordering function in the Target RAN. As part of
the functionality, constructing of end marker packets can either be done
in the SMF or in the UPF, as described in clauses 5.8.2.9.1 and
5.8.2.9.2. Whether constructing of end marker packets is performed by
SMF or UPF is determined by network configuration.

##### 5.8.2.9.1 UPF Constructing the \"End marker\" Packets

In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure without UPF change, SMF
shall indicate the UPF to switch the N3 path(s) by sending an N4 Session
Modification Request message with the new AN Tunnel Info of NG RAN and
in addition, provide an indication to the UPF to send the end marker
packet(s) on the old N3 user plane path.

On receiving this indication, the UPF shall construct end marker
packet(s) and send it for each N3 GTP-U tunnel towards the source NG RAN
after sending the last PDU on the old path.

In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure with change of the UPF
terminating N3, the SMF shall request the UPF with N9 reference point to
the UPF terminating N3 to switch the N9 user plane path(s) by sending an
N4 Session Modification Request message (N4 session ID, new CN Tunnel
Info of the UPF terminating N3) and in addition, provide an indication
to this UPF to send the end marker packet(s) on the old path.

On receiving this indication, the UPF shall construct end marker
packet(s) and send it for each N9 GTP-U tunnel towards the source UPF
after sending the last PDU on the old path.

On receiving the end marker packet(s) on N9 GTP-U tunnel, source UPF
shall forward the end marker packet(s) and send it for each N3 GTP-U
tunnel towards the source NG RAN.

##### 5.8.2.9.2 SMF Constructing the \"End marker\" Packets

UPF referred in this clause is the UPF terminates N3 reference point.

It is assumed that the PDU Session for the UE comprises of an UPF that
acts as a PDU Session Anchor and an intermediate UPF terminating N3
reference point at the time of this Handover procedure.

In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure without UPF change, SMF
shall indicate the UPF to switch the N3 path(s) by sending an N4 Session
Modification Request message (N4 session ID, new AN Tunnel Info of NG
RAN). After sending the last PDU on the old path, UPF shall replace the
old AN Tunnel Info with the new one and responds with an N4 Session
Modification Response message to acknowledge the success of path switch.

When the path switch is finished, SMF constructs the end marker
packet(s) and sends it to the UPF. UPF then forwards the packet(s) to
the source NG RAN.

In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure with UPF change, SMF
shall indicate the PSA UPF to switch the N9 user plane path(s) by
sending an N4 Session Modification Request message (N4 session ID, new
CN Tunnel Info of UPF). After sending the last PDU on the old N9 path,
PSA UPF shall replace the old CN Tunnel Info with the new one and
responds with an N4 Session Modification Response message to acknowledge
the success of path switch.

When the path switch is finished, SMF constructs the end marker
packet(s) and sends it to PSA UPF. PSA UPF then forwards the packet(s)
to the source UPF.

#### 5.8.2.10 UP Tunnel Management

5GC shall support per PDU Session tunnelling on N3 between (R)AN and UPF
and N9 between UPFs. If there exist more than one UPF involved for the
PDU Session, any tunnel(s) between UPFs (e.g. in the case of two UPFs,
between the UPF that is an N3 terminating point and the UPF for PDU
Session Anchor) remains established when a UE enters CM-IDLE state. In
the case of downlink data buffering by UPF, when mobile terminated (MT)
traffic arrives at the PDU Session Anchor UPF, it is forwarded to the
UPF which buffer the data packet via N9 tunnel. See clause 5.8.3 for
more details on UPF buffering. In the case of Home Routed roaming, the
SMF in HPLMN is not aware of the UP activation state of a PDU Session.

When the UP connection of the PDU Session is deactivated, the SMF may
release the UPF of N3 terminating point. In that case the UPF (e.g. the
Branching Point/UL CL or PDU Session Anchor) connecting to the released
UPF of N3 terminating point will buffer the DL packets. Otherwise, when
the UPF with the N3 connection is not released, this UPF will buffer the
DL packets.

When the UP connection of the PDU Session is activated due to a
down-link data arrived and a new UPF is allocated to terminate the N3
connection, a data forwarding tunnel between the UPF that has buffered
packets and the newly allocated UPF is established, so that the buffered
data packets are transferred from the old UPF that has buffered packets
to the newly allocated UPF via the data forwarding tunnel.

For a PDU Session whose the UP connection is deactivated and the SMF has
subscribed the location change notification, when the SMF is notified of
UE\'s new location from the AMF and detects that the UE has moved out of
the service area of the existing intermediate UPF, the SMF may decide to
maintain the intermediate UPF, remove the established tunnel between
UPFs (in the case of removal of the intermediate UPF) or reallocate the
tunnel between UPFs (in the case of reallocation of the intermediate
UPF).

#### 5.8.2.11 Parameters for N4 session management

##### 5.8.2.11.1 General

These parameters are used by SMF to control the functionality of the UPF
as well as to inform SMF about events occurring at the UPF.

The N4 session management procedures defined in clause 4.4.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] will use the relevant parameters in the same way for all
N4 reference points: the N4 Session Establishment procedure as well as
the N4 Session Modification procedure provide the control parameters to
the UPF, the N4 Session Release procedure removes all control parameters
related to an N4 session, and the N4 Session Level Reporting procedure
informs the SMF about events related to the PDU Session that are
detected by the UPF.

The parameters over N4 reference point provided from SMF to UPF
comprises an N4 Session ID and may also contain:

\- Packet Detection Rules (PDR) that contain information to classify
traffic (PDU(s)) arriving at the UPF;

\- Forwarding Action Rules (FAR) that contain information on whether
forwarding, dropping or buffering is to be applied to a traffic
identified by PDR(s);

\- Multi-Access Rules (MAR) that contain information on how to handle
traffic steering, switching and splitting for a MA PDU Session;

\- Usage Reporting Rules (URR) contains information that defines how
traffic identified by PDR(s) shall be accounted as well as how a certain
measurement shall be reported;

\- QoS Enforcement Rules (QER), that contain information related to QoS
enforcement of traffic identified by PDR(s);

\- Session Reporting Rules (SRR) that contain information to request the
UP function to detect and report events for a PDU session that are not
related to specific PDRs of the PDU session or that are not related to
traffic usage measurement.

\- Trace Requirements;

\- Port Management Information Container in 5GS;

\- Bridge Information.

The N4 Session ID is assigned by the SMF and uniquely identifies an N4
session.

If the UPF indicated support of Trace, the SMF may activate a trace
session during a N4 Session Establishment or a N4 Session Modification
procedure. In that case it provides Trace Requirements to the UPF. The
SMF may deactivate an on-going trace session using a N4 Session
Modification procedure. There shall be at most one trace session
activated per N4 Session at a time.

For the MA PDU Session, the SMF may add an additional access tunnel
information during an N4 Session Modification procedure by updating MAR
with addition of an FAR ID which refers to an FAR containing the
additional access tunnel information for the MA PDU session for traffic
steering in the UPF. For the MA PDU Session, the SMF may request Access
Availability report per N4 Session, during N4 Session Establishment
procedure or N4 Session Modification procedure.

A N4 Session may be used to control both UPF and NW-TT behaviour in the
UPF. A N4 session support and enable exchange of TSN bridge
configuration between the SMF and the UPF:

\- Information that the SMF needs for bridge management
(clause 5.8.2.11.9);

\- Information that 5GS transparently relays between the TSN AF or NEF
and the NW-TT: transparent Port Management Information Container along
with the associated NW-TT port number.

\- Information that 5GS transparently relays between the TSN AF or NEF
and the NW-TT: transparent user plane node Management Information
Container (clause 5.8.2.11.14).

When a N4 Session related with bridge management is established, the UPF
allocates a dedicated port number for the DS-TT side of the PDU Session.
The UPF then provides to the SMF following configuration parameters for
the N4 Session:

\- DS-TT port number.

\- user-plane node ID.

To support TSN, the user-plane node ID is Bridge ID. The User Plane Node
ID/Bridge ID may be pre-configured in the UPF based on deployment.

After the N4 session has been established, the SMF and UPF may at any
time exchange transparent user plane node and Port Management
Information Container over a N4 session.

##### 5.8.2.11.2 N4 Session Context

N4 Session Context is identified by an N4 Session ID. An N4 Session
Context is generated by SMF and UPF respectively to store the parameters
related to an N4 session, including the N4 session ID and following
information (see TS 29.244 \[65\] for an exhaustive list):

1\) general session related parameters such as S-NSSAI, PDU Session
Type, Trace Information, APN/DNN, ATSSS Control Information;

2\) the PDRs, URRs, QERs, BAR(s), FARs, MARs used for this N4 session;

3\) parameters sent to support UPF statistics.

The UPF may use parameters listed above in bullets 1) (e.g. S-NSSAI) and
2) (e.g. Network Instance in PDR/FAR(s)) for determining internal UPF
resources.

##### 5.8.2.11.3 Packet Detection Rule

The following table describes the Packet Detection Rule (PDR) containing
information required to classify a packet arriving at the UPF. Every PDR
is used to detect packets in a certain transmission direction, e.g. UL
direction or DL direction.

##### 5.8.2.11.4 QoS Enforcement Rule

The following table describes the QoS Enforcement Rule (QER) that
defines how a packet shall be treated in terms of bit rate limitation
and packet marking for QoS purposes. All Packet Detection Rules that
refer to the same QER share the same QoS resources, e.g. MFBR.

##### 5.8.2.11.7 Usage Report generated by UPF

The UPF sends the Usage Report to inform the SMF about the measurement
of an active URR or about the detection of application traffic of an
active Packet Detection Rule. For each URR, the Usage Report may be
generated repeatedly, i.e. as long as any one of the valid event
triggers applies. A final Usage Report is sent for a URR when it is no
longer active, i.e. either the URR is removed or all the references to
this URR in any of the Packet Detection Rules belonging to the N4
session.

The following attributes can be included:

#### 5.8.2.12 Reporting of the UE MAC addresses used in a PDU Session

For Ethernet PDU Session type, the SMF may control the UPF to report the
different MAC (Ethernet) addresses used as source address of frames sent
UL by the UE in a PDU Session. These MAC addresses are called UE MAC
addresses.

This control and the corresponding reporting takes place over N4.

NOTE: This is e.g. used to support reporting of all UE MAC addresses in
a PDU Session to the PCF as described in clause 5.6.10.2.

The UPF reports the removal of a UE MAC address based on the detection
of absence of traffic during an inactivity time. The inactivity time
value is provided by the SMF to the UPF.

#### 5.8.2.13 Support for 5G VN group communication

##### 5.8.2.13.0 General

The SMF may configure the UPF(s) to apply different traffic forwarding
methods to route traffic between PDU Sessions for a single 5G VN group.
For example, depending on the destination address, some packet flows may
be forwarded locally, while other packet flows are forwarded via N19 and
other packet flows are forwarded to N6.

The UPF local switching, N6-based forwarding and N19-based forwarding
methods require that a common SMF is controlling the PSA UPFs for the 5G
VN group.

5G VN group communication includes one to one communication and one to
many communication. One to one communication supports forwarding of
unicast traffic between two UEs within a 5G VN, or between a UE and a
device on the DN. One to many communication supports forwarding of
multicast traffic and broadcast traffic from one UE (or device on the
DN) to many/all UEs within a 5G VN and devices on the DN.

Traffic forwarding within the 5G VN group is realized by using a UPF
internal interface (\"5G VN internal\") and a two-step detection and
forwarding process. In the first step, the packets received from any 5G
VN group member (via it\'s PDU Session, via N6 or via N19) are forwarded
to the UPF internal interface (i.e. Destination Interface set to \"5G VN
internal\"). In the second step, PDRs installed at the UPF internal
interface (i.e. Source Interface set to \"5G VN internal\") detect the
packet and forward it to the respective 5G VN group member (via it\'s
PDU Session, via N6 or via N19). The details of the PDR and FAR
configuration are described in the following clauses.

For UEs belonging to the same 5G VN group and having PDU Sessions that
correspond to N4 Sessions in the same PSA UPF, the following applies for
traffic that is sent from one of these UEs to another one of these UEs
using local switching: The incoming traffic for one PDU Session will
match the corresponding N4 Session\'s PDR(s) of the source PDU Session
(based on GTP-U header information). The traffic is then sent back to
classification in that UPF (via the internal interface) and will match
another N4 Session corresponding to the destination PDU Session (based
on destination address in the PDU). The PDU is then forwarded to the
target UE.

If 5G VN group members\' PDU Sessions are served by different PSA UPFs
and N19-based forwarding is applied, the SMF creates a group-level N4
Session with each involved UPF to enable N19-based forwarding and
N6-based forwarding. When the traffic is then sent back to
classification in that UPF (via the internal interface) it may match
group-level N4 Session corresponding to the 5G VN group (based on
destination address in the PDU or a default PDR rule with match-all
packet filter). The PDU is then forwarded to N6 or to the UPF indicated
in the group-level N4 Session via corresponding N19 tunnel. This enables
the PDU to be sent to the target group member in the other UPF or to the
device in the DN.

In the case of N19-based forwarding is not applied for a 5G VN group,
group level N4 session is not required.

If more than one 5G VN group has to be supported in the PLMN, the N4
rule attribute Network Instance is used in addition to the UPF internal
interface and set to a value representing the 5G VN group. This keeps
the traffic of different 5G VN groups separate from each other and thus
enables isolation of the 5G VN group communication during the packet
detection and forwarding process. The SMF shall provide the PDRs and
FARs related to the UPF internal interface as follows whenever more than
one 5G VN group has to be supported in the PLMN:

\- The FAR with Destination Interface set to \"5G VN internal\" shall
also contain the Network Instance set to the value representing the 5G
VN group.

\- The PDR with Source Interface set to \"5G VN internal\" shall also
contain the Network Instance set to the value representing the 5G VN
group.

Forwarding Ethernet unicast traffic towards the PDU Session
corresponding to the Destination MAC address of an Ethernet frame may
correspond:

\- either to the SMF explicitly configuring DL PDR(s) with the MAC
addresses detected by the UPF on PDU Sessions and reported to the SMF;
this is further described in clause 5.8.2.13.1;

\- or to the SMF relying on MAC address learning in UPF as defined in
clause 5.8.2.5.3. To request this UPF behaviour the SMF sets the
Ethernet PDU Session Information indication in the DL PDR of the \"5G VN
internal\" interface related with a 5G VN group. This may apply in the
case that all PDU Sessions related with this 5G VN group are served by
the same PSA or by multiple PSAs not inter-connected via N19.

For Ethernet traffic on 5G-VN, in the former case above where SMF
explicitly configures DL PDR with the MAC addresses detected on PDU
Sessions supporting a 5G VN group, the SMF acts as a central controller
which is responsible for setting up the forwarding rules in the UPFs so
that it avoids forwarding loops. The SMF becomes aware of the MAC
addresses in use within a 5G VN group by the UPF\'s reporting of the MAC
addresses. The SMF is responsible to react to topology changes in the
Ethernet network. Local switching without SMF involvement is not
specified for a 5G-VN when different PDU Sessions related with this 5G
VN group may be served by different PSA(s) connected over N19.

NOTE: The mechanisms described above implies signalling on N4 Sessions
related with a VN group each time a new MAC address is detected as used
(or no more used) within a PDU Session related with this 5G VN group.
Hence the usage of the solution with SMF explicitly configuring DL PDR
with the MAC addresses defined in this release can raise signalling
scalability issues for large VN groups with lots of devices (MAC
addresses) served by PDU sessions related with this VN group.

##### 5.8.2.13.1 Support for unicast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN

To enable unicast traffic forwarding in a UPF, the following applies:

\- The SMF provides for each 5G VN group member\'s N4 Session (i.e. N4
Session corresponding to PDU Session) the following N4 rules that enable
the processing of packets received from this UE.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"access side\", and CN Tunnel Information set to PDU Session tunnel
header (i.e. N3 or N9 GTP-U F-TEID); and

\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"5G VN internal\".

\- The SMF provides for each 5G VN group member\'s N4 Session (i.e. N4
session corresponding to PDU Session) the following N4 rules that enable
the processing of packets towards this UE.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", and Destination Address set to the IP/MAC address
(es) of this 5G VN group member; and

\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Outer Header
Creation indicating the N3/N9 tunnel information, and Destination
Interface set \"access side\".

\- If N19-based forwarding is applied, the SMF configures the
group-level N4 Session for processing packets received from a N19 tunnel
with the following N4 rules for each N19 tunnel.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"core side\", and CN Tunnel Information set to N19 tunnel header
(i.e. N19 GTP-U F-TEID); and

\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"5G VN internal\".

\- If N19-based forwarding is applied, the SMF configures the
group-level N4 Session for processing packets towards 5G VN group
members anchored at other UPFs with the following N4 rules for each N19
tunnel.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", and Destination Address set to the IP/MAC address
(es) of UEs anchored at the peer UPF of this N19 tunnel; and

\- in order to forward the traffic to a 5G VN group member anchored at
another UPF via the N19 tunnel, a FAR containing Outer Header Creation
indicating the N19 tunnel information, Destination Interface set to
\"core side\".

\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
received from a 5G VN group member connected via N6 with the following
N4 rules.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"core side\", and Source Address set to the IP/MAC address (es) of
this 5G VN group member; and

\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"5G VN internal\".

\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
towards a 5G VN group member connected via N6 or packets towards a
device residing in DN with the following N4 rules.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", and Destination Address set to the IP/MAC address
(es) of this 5G VN group member; and

\- in order to forward the traffic to the 5G VN group member or device
via N6, a FAR containing Destination Interface set to \"core side\".

\- The SMF shall update N4 rules for group-level N4 Session to enable
correct forwarding of packets towards UE who\'s PSA UPF has been
reallocated and address is unchanged.

\- The SMF may also configure the following N4 rules for the group-level
N4 Session to process packets with an unknown destination address:

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", a match-all Packet Filter, and a Precedence set
to the lowest precedence value; and

\- in order to process the traffic, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"core side\" to route the traffic via N6 by default,
or in the case of local SMF configuration that N6-based forwarding is
not applied a FAR instructing the UPF to drop the traffic.

##### 5.8.2.13.2 Support for unicast traffic forwarding update due to UE mobility

To enable the service continuity when the PSA UPF serving the UE
changed, the following applies:

\- Keep the UE address unchanged if N6-based forwarding is not used.

\- Configure the UE\'s N4 Session with N4 rules (PDR, FAR) to detect and
forward the traffic to this UE via its PDU Session tunnel(i.e. N3
tunnel) on the target PSA UPF.

\- If N19-based forwarding is applied: To switch the traffic towards
this UE from the source PSA UPF to the target PSA UPF for N19-based
forwarding, the SMF deletes the N4 rule (PDR) that detects the traffic
towards this UE in the group-level N4 Session at UPFs involved in the 5G
VN group (except the source PSA UPF), then adds or updates the PDR that
detects the traffic towards this UE with the FAR containing the N19
tunnel information of the target PSA UPF in the group-level N4 Session
at UPFs involved in the 5G VN group (except the target PSA UPF).

##### 5.8.2.13.3 Support for user plane traffic replication in a 5G VN

##### 5.8.2.13.3.1 User plane traffic replication based on UPF internal functionality {#user-plane-traffic-replication-based-on-upf-internal-functionality .H6}

For Ethernet PDU Sessions, the SMF may instruct the UPF to route traffic
to be replicated as described in clause 5.8.2.5.

For IP PDU Session types, the SMF may instruct the UPF to manage IP
multicast traffic as described in clauses 4.6.6 and 7.7.1 of
TS 23.316 \[84\]. The UPF replicates the IP multicast traffic received
from PDU Sessions or N6 interface and sends the packets over other PDU
Sessions and other N6 interface subscribed to the IP Multicast groups.

Mechanisms described in clauses 4.6.6 and 7.7.1 of TS 23.316 \[84\]
apply to support 5G VN group communication with following
clarifications:

\- These mechanisms are not limited to Wireline access and can apply on
any access,

\- IP Multicast traffic allowed for a PDU Session is not meant for IPTV
services reachable over N6,

\- IGMP /MLD signalling does not relate with STB or 5G-RG: Clauses 4.6.6
and 7.7.1 of TS 23.316 \[84\], apply to UE members of a 5G VN group
instead of 5G-RG, and

\- Clauses 7.7.1.1.2 and 7.7.1.1.4 of TS 23.316 \[84\] are not
applicable to 5G VN groups: members of the 5G VN groups may receive any
multicast traffic associated with the (DNN, S-NSSAI) of the 5G VN group.

\- UPF exchange of signalling such as PIM (Protocol-Independent
Multicast) may apply as defined in TS 23.316, with following
clarification:

\- PIM signalling is generally exchanged over N6 but may be sent towards
the PDU Session supporting the source address of multicast traffic
identified by IGMP / MLD signalling for Source Specific Multicast. In
the case of IGMP / MLD signalling not related with Source Specific
Multicast no PIM signalling is sent towards any PDU Session

##### 5.8.2.13.3.2 User plane traffic replication based on PDRs with replication instructions {#user-plane-traffic-replication-based-on-pdrs-with-replication-instructions .H6}

Alternatively, for IP or Ethernet type data communication, the SMF
instructs the UPF via PDRs and FARs how to replicate user plane traffic.

The mechanism is supported in the following conditions:

\- When N19 is used, there is a full mesh of N19 tunnels between UPFs
serving the 5G VN group;

\- There is no support of forwarding packets with destination MAC
address not known by SMF/UPF (i.e. no support for new UE MAC addresses
from the UE during the PDU Session lifetime)

\- There is no support for forwarding a broadcast/multicast packet with
source address not known to SMF/UPF.

\- Each UPF supports one N6 interface instance towards the data network,
or only supports N19-based forwarding without N6;

\- Multicast group formation of selected members of a 5G VN for Ethernet
type data communication is not described in this release of the
specification.

In this case, when the UPF receives a broadcast packet of a 5G VN group
from N19 or N6, it shall distribute it to all 5G VN group members
connected to this UPF. When the UPF receives a broadcast packet from a
UE (source UE) via PDU Session associated with a 5G VN group, it shall
distribute it to:

\- All 5G VN group members (except the source UE) connected to this UPF
via local switch, and

\- All 5G VN group members connected to other UPFs via N19-based
forwarding, and

\- The devices on the DN via N6-based forwarding.

To enable broadcast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN group in a UPF, the
following applies:

\- The SMF provides group-level N4 Session and each 5G VN group member\'
N4 Session with the PDR that detect the broadcast packet sent via
\"internal interface\". When UPF receives the broadcast packets sent via
\"internal interface\", it matches the broadcast packet against all PDRs
installed at the \"internal interface\". A successful matching with a
PDR that detect the broadcast packet instructs the UPF to continue the
lookup of the other PDRs. A matching PDR that detects the broadcast
packet shall instruct the UPF to duplicate the broadcast packet and
perform processing (using associated FAR, URR, QER) on the copy instead
of the original packet if the broadcast packet does not satisfy the
packet replication skip information, otherwise the PDR instructs the UPF
to skip the processing of the broadcast packet.

\- The broadcast packets received from N19 or N6 are forwarded to the
UPF internal interface together with a N19 or N6 indication.

\- The SMF provides for each 5G VN group member\' N4 Session (i.e. N4
session corresponding to PDU Session) the following N4 rules that enable
the processing of broadcast packets towards this UE.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", Destination Address set to the broadcast address,
the Packet replication skip information set to the IP/MAC address (es)
of this 5G VN group member, and the indication to carry on matching; and

\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Outer Header
Creation indicating the PDU Session tunnel information, and Destination
Interface set \"access side\".

\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
received from a N19 tunnel with the following N4 rules for each N19
tunnel.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"core side\", Destination Address set to the broadcast address, and
CN Tunnel Information set to N19 tunnel header (i.e. N19 GTP-U TEID);
and

\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"5G VN internal\", Outer Header Creation with the N19
indication.

\- The SMF provides for the group-level N4 Session the following N4
rules that enable the processing of broadcast packets towards the other
UPFs.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", Destination Address set to the broadcast address,
the Packet replication skip information set to the N19 indication, and
the indication to carry on matching; and

\- in order to forward the traffic to each involved UPF via the
corresponding N19 tunnel, a FAR containing \"Duplication\" instruction,
Outer Header Creation indicating the N19 tunnel information, Destination
Interface set to \"core side\".

\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
received from N6 with the following N4 rules.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"core side\", and Destination Address set to the broadcast address;
and

\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"5G VN internal\", Outer Header Creation with the N6
indication.

\- The SMF provides for the group-level N4 Session the following N4
rules that enable the processing of broadcast packets towards N6.

\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", a match-all packet filter, and the Packet
replication skip information set to the N6 indication; and

\- in order to forward the traffic to N6, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"core side\".

In this case, to enable multicast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN group in
a UPF, broadcast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN applies to multicast
traffic forwarding of a 5G VN with the following modifications:

\- The SMF installs PDRs for the multicast address instead of the
broadcast address.

\- The PDRs and FARs are installed for PDU Sessions corresponding to the
members of the multicast group.

\- In addition, the SMF installs the PDR identifying IGMP/MLD signalling
for each 5G VN group member\' N4 Session and a URR with a Reporting
Trigger set to \"IGMP reporting\" for IGMP or set to \"MLD reporting\"
for MLD. Based on the IP Multicast address in \"IP multicast join\" or
\"IP multicast leave\" reports received from UPF, the SMF manipulates
(delete or add) the PDR identifying the multicast traffic for the
reported IP Multicast address at the corresponding 5G VN group member\'
N4 Session, and if required at the group-level N4 Session at the UPF(s)
of the 5G VN group.

#### 5.8.2.14 Inter PLMN User Plane Security functionality

Operators can deploy UPF(s) supporting the Inter PLMN User Plane
Security (IPUPS) functionality at the border of their network to protect
their networks from invalid inter PLMN N9 traffic.

The IPUPS functionality forwards GTP-U packets (received via the N9
interface) only if they belong to an active PDU Session and are not
malformed, as described in TS 33.501 \[29\].

The SMF can activate the IPUPS functionality together with other UP
functionality in the same UPF, or insert a separate UPF in the UP path
for the IPUPS functionality. In both cases the UPF with IPUPS
functionality is controlled by the SMF via the N4 interface.

#### 5.8.2.15 Reporting of satellite backhaul to SMF

If the AMF is aware that a satellite backhaul with long delay is used
towards 5G AN, the AMF may report this to SMF as part of the PDU Session
establishment procedure as described in clause 4.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].
If AMF is aware that satellite backhaul category changes (e.g. at
handover), the AMF reports the current satellite backhaul category and
indicates the satellite backhaul category change to SMF.

Satellite backhaul category refers to the type of the satellite (i.e.
GEO, MEO, LEO or OTHERSAT) used in the backhaul. Only a single backhaul
category can be indicated.

NOTE: It is assumed that the AMF can determine the Satellite backhaul
category for the notification to the SMF based on local configuration,
e.g. based on Global RAN Node IDs associated with satellite backhaul.

#### 5.8.2.16 Support for L2TP tunnelling on N6

If requested by the SMF during N4 Session Establishment, the UPF (PSA)
may setup L2TP towards an L2TP network server (LNS) in the DN and tunnel
the PDU Session user plane traffic in this L2TP tunnel. In this case the
UPF acts as a L2TP access concentrator (LAC).

To enable this, the SMF may provide L2TP information to the UPF, such as
LNS IP address and/or LNS host name, as described in TS 29.244 \[65\].
This L2TP information may be configured on the SMF as part of the DNN
configuration or received from the DN-AAA Server during secondary
authentication/authorization, as described in clause 5.6.6.
Alternatively, the L2TP tunnel parameters may be configured in the UPF
Function. The L2TP tunnel parameters include necessary parameters for
setting up L2TP tunnel towards the LNS (e.g. LNS address, tunnel
password, etc.).

In addition, the SMF may provide PAP/CHAP authentication information to
the UPF, for use in L2TP session establishment, in case it was received
from the UE in the PDU Session Establishment Request.

When L2TP is to be used for a PDU Session, the SMF may select a UPF
based upon support of this feature. The SMF determines whether the UPF
supports this feature via N4 capability negotiation during N4
Association Setup or via NRF discovery.

If SMF requests the UPF to allocate UE IP address, as described in
clause 5.8.2.2.1, the UPF (LAC) may retrieve this IP address from the
LNS. In addition, if the SMF requests the UPF to provide DNS
address(es), the UPF (LAC) may request the LNS to provide DNS
address(es) and report such DNS address(es) to the SMF.

### 5.8.3 Explicit Buffer Management

#### 5.8.3.1 General

5GC supports buffering of UE\'s downlink packets for deactivated PDU
Sessions.

Support for buffering in the UPF is mandatory and optional in the SMF.

When the UP connection of a PDU Session is deactivated, buffering in UPF
can be activated by the SMF. If the SMF supports buffering capability,
the SMF can decide to activate buffering in SMF instead of buffering in
UPF.

#### 5.8.3.2 Buffering at UPF

When the SMF decided to activate buffering in UPF, the SMF shall inform
the UPF to start buffering packets for this PDU Session.

The SMF provides instructions to the UPF for at least the following
behaviour:

\- buffer downlink packets with the following additional options:

\- reporting the arrival of first downlink packet (for a QoS Flow or a
service data flow), and/or

\- reporting the first discarded downlink packet (for a service data
flow), or

\- drop downlink packets with the following additional options:

\- reporting the first discarded downlink packet (for a service data
flow).

\- buffer uplink packets.

When the SMF instructs the UPF for a service data flow to buffer
downlink packets and to report the first discarded downlink packet, the
SMF shall also instruct the UPF to report the arrival of the first
downlink packet for this service data flow to enable the SMF check if
this is also the first report for the QoS Flow (as described below).

Buffering in the UPF may be configured based on timers or the amount of
downlink data to be buffered. The SMF decides whether buffering timers
or amount of downlink data are handled by the UPF or SMF.

After starting buffering, when the first downlink packet (of a QoS Flow
or a service data flow) arrives, UPF shall inform the SMF if it is setup
to report. UPF sends a Downlink Data Report to the SMF via N4 unless
specified otherwise and indicates the PDR by which the downlink packet
was received. If the SMF receives a Downlink Data Report for a service
data flow, the SMF shall also check if this is the first report for the
QoS Flow corresponding to the PDR. If so, the SMF shall also proceed as
described in clause 5.4.3.1.

After starting buffering, when the first downlink packet (of a service
data flow) in a configured period of time that has been buffered is
discarded by the UPF because the configured buffering time or amount of
downlink data to be buffered is exceeded, the UPF shall inform the SMF
if it is setup to report. UPF sends a Downlink Data Report to the SMF
via N4 and indicates the PDR by which the discarded downlink packet was
received.

A new report is sent if the SMF terminates and subsequently re-activates
the buffering action at the UPF and the UPF again receives downlink
packets.

NOTE: For the notification about the downlink data delivery status
\"buffered\" or \"discarded\" related to packets from a particular AF as
part of the Nsmf_EventExposure service, it is expected that a PDR with a
traffic filter identifying that AF as source and a Forwarding Action
rule with action \"buffer\" is installed.

When the UP connection of the PDU Session is activated, the SMF updates
the UPF of the change in buffering state. The buffered downlink packets,
if any, are then forwarded to the (R)AN by the UPF.

If the UP connection of the PDU Session has been deactivated for a long
time, the SMF may indicate the UPF to stop buffering for this PDU
Session.

The SMF may indicate to the UPF to start or stop the buffering of uplink
packets of an application associated to the PCC rule as described in
clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.548 \[130\]. When the buffering of uplink packets
is stopped the UPF shall forward all buffered uplink packets before it
forwards any new uplink packets.

#### 5.8.3.3 Buffering at SMF

When the SMF supports buffering capability and the SMF decided to
activate buffering in SMF for the PDU Session, the SMF shall inform the
UPF to start forwarding the downlink packets towards the SMF.

When the UP connection of the PDU Session is activated, if there are
buffered downlink packets available and their buffering duration has not
expired, the SMF shall forward those packets to the UPF to relay them to
the UE. These packets are then forwarded by the UPF to the (R)AN.

### 5.8.4 SMF Pause of Charging

The SMF Pause of Charging functionality is supported with the purpose
that the charging and usage monitoring data in the core network more
accurately reflects the downlink traffic actually sent to the (R)AN.
When the amount of downlink data incoming at the UPF for a PDU Session
that is in deactivated state goes above a pre-configured threshold, the
pause of charging functionality ensures that data that dropped in the
core network is not included in charging and usage monitoring records.

The procedures for SMF Pause of Charging are described in
TS 23.502 \[3\].

## 5.9 Identifiers

### 5.9.1 General

Each subscriber in the 5G System shall be allocated one 5G Subscription
Permanent Identifier (SUPI) for use within the 3GPP system. The 5G
System supports identification of subscriptions independently of
identification of the user equipment. Each UE accessing the 5G System
shall be assigned a Permanent Equipment Identifier (PEI).

The 5G System supports allocation of a temporary identifier (5G-GUTI) in
order to support user confidentiality protection.

### 5.9.2 Subscription Permanent Identifier

A globally unique 5G Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) shall be
allocated to each subscriber in the 5G System and provisioned in the
UDM/UDR. The SUPI is used only inside 3GPP system, and its privacy is
specified in TS 33.501 \[29\].

The SUPI may contain:

\- an IMSI as defined in TS 23.003 \[19\], or

\- a network-specific identifier, used for private networks as defined
in TS 22.261 \[2\].

\- a GLI and an operator identifier of the 5GC operator, used for
supporting FN-BRGs, as further described in TS 23.316 \[84\].

\- a GCI and an operator identifier of the 5GC operator, used for
supporting FN-CRGs and 5G-CRG, as further described in TS 23.316 \[84\].

A SUPI containing a network-specific identifier shall take the form of a
Network Access Identifier (NAI) using the NAI RFC 7542 \[20\] based user
identification as defined in TS 23.003 \[19\].

When UE needs to indicate its SUPI to the network (e.g. as part of the
Registration procedure), the UE provides the SUPI in concealed form as
defined in TS 23.003 \[19\].

In order to enable roaming scenarios, the SUPI shall contain the address
of the home network (e.g. the MCC and MNC in the case of an IMSI based
SUPI).

For interworking with the EPC, the SUPI allocated to the 3GPP UE shall
always be based on an IMSI to enable the UE to present an IMSI to the
EPC.

The usage of SUPI for W-5GAN is further specified in TS 23.316 \[84\].

### 5.9.2a Subscription Concealed Identifier

The Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) is a privacy preserving
identifier containing the concealed SUPI. It is specified in
TS 33.501 \[29\].

The usage of SUCI for W-5GAN access is further specified in
TS 23.316 \[84\].

### 5.9.3 Permanent Equipment Identifier

A Permanent Equipment Identifier (PEI) is defined for the 3GPP UE
accessing the 5G System.

The PEI can assume different formats for different UE types and use
cases. The UE shall present the PEI to the network together with an
indication of the PEI format being used.

If the UE supports at least one 3GPP access technology (i.e. NG-RAN,
E-UTRAN, UTRAN or GERAN), the UE must be allocated a PEI in the IMEI or
IMEISV format.

If a UE has registered with a network by using a network subscription
and a PEI of the UE, then the UE shall keep the PEI to be used with the
network subscription and shall not use that PEI with another network
subscription while the UE is in registered state in the network.

In the scope of this release, the PEI may be one of the following:

\- for UEs that support at least one 3GPP access technology, an IMEI or
IMEISV, as defined in TS 23.003 \[19\];

\- PEI used in the case of W-5GAN access as further specified in
TS 23.316 \[84\].

\- for UEs not supporting any 3GPP access technologies, the IEEE
Extended Unique Identifier EUI-64 \[113\] of the access technology the
UE uses to connect to the 5GC.

### 5.9.4 5G Globally Unique Temporary Identifier

The AMF shall allocate a 5G Globally Unique Temporary Identifier
(5G-GUTI) to the UE that is common to both 3GPP and non-3GPP access. It
shall be possible to use the same 5G-GUTI for accessing 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access security context within the AMF for the given UE. An AMF
may re-assign a new 5G-GUTI to the UE at any time. The AMF provides a
new 5G-GUTI to the UE under the conditions specified in clause 6.12.3 of
TS 33.501 \[29\]. When the UE is in CM-IDLE, the AMF may delay providing
the UE with a new 5G-GUTI until the next NAS transaction.

The 5G-GUTI shall be structured as:

\<5G-GUTI\> := \<GUAMI\> \<5G-TMSI\>

where GUAMI identifies one or more AMF(s).

When the GUAMI identifies only one AMF, the 5G-TMSI identifies the UE
uniquely within the AMF. However, when AMF assigns a 5G-GUTI to the UE
with a GUAMI value used by more than one AMF, the AMF shall ensure that
the 5G-TMSI value used within the assigned 5G-GUTI is not already in use
by the other AMF(s) sharing that GUAMI value.

The Globally Unique AMF ID (GUAMI) shall be structured as:

\<GUAMI\> := \<MCC\> \<MNC\> \<AMF Region ID\> \<AMF Set ID\> \<AMF
Pointer\>

where AMF Region ID identifies the region, AMF Set ID uniquely
identifies the AMF Set within the AMF Region and AMF Pointer identifies
one or more AMFs within the AMF Set.

NOTE 1: The AMF Region ID addresses the case that there are more AMFs in
the network than the number of AMFs that can be supported by AMF Set ID
and AMF Pointer by enabling operators to re-use the same AMF Set IDs and
AMF Pointers in different regions.

NOTE 2: In the case of SNPNs, the PLMN IDs may be shared among SNPNs
such that the constructed GUAMIs are not globally unique. However, PLMN
ID and NID are provided together, separate from the GUAMI, to uniquely
identify selected or supported SNPN in RRC and N2.

NOTE 3: See TS 23.003 \[19\] for details on the structure of the fields
of GUAMI.

The 5G-S-TMSI is the shortened form of the GUTI to enable more efficient
radio signalling procedures (e.g. during Paging and Service Request) and
is defined as:

\<5G-S-TMSI\> := \<AMF Set ID\> \<AMF Pointer\> \<5G-TMSI\>

As specified in TS 38.304 \[50\] and TS 36.304 \[52\] for 3GPP access,
the NG-RAN uses the 10 Least Significant Bits of the 5G-TMSI in the
determination of the time at which different UEs are paged. Hence, the
AMF shall ensure that the 10 Least Significant Bits of the 5G-TMSI are
evenly distributed.

As specified in TS 38.331 \[28\] and TS 36.331 \[51\] for 3GPP access,
the NG-RAN\'s RRC Connection Establishment\'s contention resolution
process assumes that there is a low probability of the same 5G-TMSI
being allocated by different AMFs to different UEs. The AMFs\' process
for allocating the 5G-TMSI should take this account.

NOTE 4: To achieve this, the AMF could, for example, use a random seed
number for any process it uses when choosing the UE\'s 5G-TMSI.

### 5.9.5 AMF Name

An AMF is identified by an AMF Name. AMF Name is a globally unique FQDN,
the structure of AMF Name FQDN is defined in TS 23.003 \[19\]. An AMF
can be configured with one or more GUAMIs. At a given time, GUAMI with
distinct AMF Pointer value is associated to one AMF name only.

### 5.9.6 Data Network Name (DNN)

A DNN is equivalent to an APN as defined in TS 23.003 \[19\]. Both
identifiers have an equivalent meaning and carry the same information.

The DNN may be used e.g. to:

\- Select a SMF and UPF(s) for a PDU Session.

\- Select N6 interface(s) for a PDU Session.

\- Determine policies to apply to this PDU Session.

The wildcard DNN is a value that can be used for the DNN field of
Subscribed DNN list of Session Management Subscription data defined in
clause 5.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The wildcard DNN can be used with an S-NSSAI for operator to allow the
subscriber to access any Data Network supported within the Network Slice
associated with the S-NSSAI.

### 5.9.7 Internal-Group Identifier

The subscription data for an UE in UDR may associate the subscriber with
groups. A group is identified by an Internal-Group Identifier.

NOTE 1: A UE can belong to a limited number of groups, the exact number
is defined in stage 3 specifications.

NOTE 2: In this Release of the specification, the support of groups is
only defined in non-roaming case.

The Internal-Group Identifier(s) corresponding to an UE are provided by
the UDM to the SMF as part Session Management Subscription data and
(when PCC applies to a PDU Session) by the SMF to the PCF. The SMF may
use this information to apply local policies and to store this
information in CDR. The PCF may use this information to enforce AF
requests as described in clause 5.6.7.

The Internal-Group Identifier(s) corresponding to an UE are provided by
the UDM to the AMF as part of Access and Mobility Subscription data. The
AMF may use this information to apply local policies (such as Group
specific NAS level congestion control defined in clause 5.19.7.5).

### 5.9.8 Generic Public Subscription Identifier

Generic Public Subscription Identifier (GPSI) is needed for addressing a
3GPP subscription in different data networks outside of the 3GPP system.
The 3GPP system stores within the subscription data the association
between the GPSI and the corresponding SUPI.

GPSIs are public identifiers used both inside and outside of the 3GPP
system.

The GPSI is either an MSISDN or an External Identifier, see
TS 23.003 \[19\]. If MSISDN is included in the subscription data, it
shall be possible that the same MSISDN value is supported in both 5GS
and EPS.

NOTE: There is no implied 1-to-1 relationship between GPSI and SUPI.

### 5.9.9 AMF UE NGAP ID

An AMF UE NGAP ID is an identifier used to identify the UE in AMF on N2
reference point. AMF allocates the AMF UE NGAP ID and send it to the
5G-AN. For the following N2 signalling interaction sent from 5G-AN to
AMF, AMF UE NGAP ID is used to identify the UE at the AMF. AMF UE NGAP
ID is unique per AMF set. AMF UE NGAP ID may be updated without AMF
change, or with AMF change as specified at clause 5.21.2.2.

### 5.9.10 UE Radio Capability ID

The UE Radio Capability ID is a short pointer with format defined in
TS 23.003 \[19\] that is used to uniquely identify a set of UE Radio
Capabilities (excluding UTRAN and NB-IoT capabilities). The UE Radio
Capability ID is assigned either by the serving PLMN or by the UE
manufacturer, as follows:

\- UE manufacturer-assigned: The UE Radio Capability ID may be assigned
by the UE manufacturer in which case it includes a UE manufacturer
identification (i.e. a Vendor ID). In this case, the UE Radio Capability
ID uniquely identifies a set of UE radio capabilities and the UE Radio
Capability for Paging for a UE by this manufacturer in any PLMN.

\- PLMN-assigned: If a UE manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
is not used by the UE or the serving network, or it is not recognised by
the serving PLMN UCMF, the UCMF may allocate UE Radio Capability IDs for
the UE corresponding to each different set of UE radio capabilities the
PLMN may receive from the UE at different times. In this case, the UE
Radio Capability IDs the UE receives are applicable to the serving PLMN
and uniquely identify the corresponding sets of UE radio capabilities
and and the UE Radio Capability for Paging(s) in this PLMN. The PLMN
assigned UE Radio Capability ID includes a Version ID in its format. The
value of the Version ID is the one configured in the UCMF, at time the
UE Radio Capability ID value is assigned. The Version ID value makes it
possible to detect whether a UE Radio Capability ID is current or
outdated.

NOTE: For the case the PLMN is configured to store PLMN assigned IDs in
the UE manufacturer-assigned operation requested list defined in
clause 5.4.4.1a, then the algorithm for assignment of PLMN-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID shall assign different UE Radio Capability IDs for
UEs with different TAC value.

The type of UE Radio Capability ID (UE manufacturer-assigned or
PLMN-assigned) is distinguished when a UE Radio Capability ID is
signalled.

## 5.10 Security aspects

### 5.10.1 General

The security features in the 5G System include:

\- Authentication of the UE by the network and vice versa (mutual
authentication between UE and network).

\- Security context generation and distribution.

\- User Plane data confidentiality and integrity protection.

\- Control Plane signalling confidentiality and integrity protection.

\- User identity confidentiality.

\- Support of LI requirements as specified in TS 33.126 \[35\] subject
to regional/national regulatory requirements, including protection of LI
data (e.g. target list) that may be stored or transferred by an NF.

Detailed security related network functions for 5G are described in
TS 33.501 \[29\].

### 5.10.2 Security Model for non-3GPP access

#### 5.10.2.1 Signalling Security

When a UE is connected via a NG-RAN and via a standalone non-3GPP
accesses, the multiple N1 instances are secured using independent NAS
security contexts, each created based on the security context in the
corresponding SEAF (e.g. in the common AMF when the UE is served by the
same AMF) derived from the UE authentication.

### 5.10.3 PDU Session User Plane Security

The User Plane Security Enforcement information provides the NG-RAN with
User Plane security policies for a PDU session. It indicates:

\- whether UP integrity protection is:

\- Required: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP integrity
protection shall apply.

\- Preferred: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP integrity
protection should apply.

\- Not Needed: UP integrity protection shall not apply on the PDU
Session.

\- whether UP confidentiality protection is:

\- Required: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP confidentiality
protection shall apply.

\- Preferred: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP confidentiality
protection should apply.

\- Not Needed: UP confidentiality shall not apply on the PDU Session.

User Plane Security Enforcement information applies only over 3GPP
access. Once determined at the establishment of the PDU Session the User
Plane Security Enforcement information applies for the life time of the
PDU Session.

NOTE 1: Applicability of UP integrity protection of UP Security
Enforcement is defined in TS 33.501 \[29\] and TS 38.300 \[27\].

The SMF determines at PDU session establishment a User Plane Security
Enforcement information for the user plane of a PDU session based on:

\- subscribed User Plane Security Policy which is part of SM
subscription information received from UDM; and

\- User Plane Security Policy locally configured per (DNN, S-NSSAI) in
the SMF that is used when the UDM does not provide User Plane Security
Policy information.

\- The maximum supported data rate per UE for integrity protection for
the DRBs, provided by the UE in the Integrity protection maximum data
rate IE during PDU Session Establishment. The UE supporting NR as
primary RAT, i.e. NG-RAN access via Standalone NR, shall set the
Integrity protection maximum data rate IE for Uplink and Downlink to
full rate at PDU Session Establishment as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\]. A
UE not supporting NR as primary RAT and supporting E-UTRA connected to
5GC, shall set the Integrity protection maximum data rate IE for Uplink
and Downlink to NULL at PDU Session Establishment as defined in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

The User Plane Security Enforcement information provides the MME with
User Plane integrity protection policies for the PDU session (PDN
Connection). The information indicates whether UP integrity protection
is:

\- Required: for all the traffic on the PDU Session (PDN Connection) UP
integrity protection shall apply.

\- Preferred: for all the traffic on the PDU Session (PDN Connection) UP
integrity protection should apply.

\- Not Needed: UP integrity protection shall not apply on the PDU
Session (PDN Connection).

In turn, the MME provides per EPS bearer User Plane Security Enforcement
information to the E-UTRAN. All the bearers within a PDN Connection
share the same User Plane integrity protection policies.

The UE capability to support user plane integrity protection with EPS is
indicated to AMF in the S1 UE network capability information. If the UE
supports user plane integrity protection with EPS, and the AMF supports
the associated functionality, the AMF indicates this to SMF at PDU
Session Establishment using NG-RAN. If the UE and AMF support user plane
integrity protection with EPS, for PDU Sessions with UP integrity
protection of UP Security Enforcement Information set to Required, the
SMF may perform the EPS bearer ID allocation procedure as described in
TS 23.502 \[3\] clause 4.11.1.4. If the UE does not support user plane
integrity protection with EPS or the AMF does not support the associated
functionality, the SMF shall not trigger the EPS bearer ID allocation
procedure in clause 4.11.1.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Unless the UE, the serving eNB and the MME support user plane integrity
protection with EPS, the SMF+PGW-C shall reject a PDN Connection
Establishment using EPS if the UP Security Enforcement Information has
UP integrity protection set to Required.

The SMF+PGW-C shall (e.g. based on the received RAT Type) reject a PDN
Connection Establishment using GERAN/UTRAN if the UP Security
Enforcement Information has UP integrity protection set to Required.

NOTE 2: This assumes that the optional user plane integrity protection
for GPRS specified in Release 13 has not been deployed.

The SMF may, based on local configuration, reject the PDU Session
Establishment request depending on the value of the maximum supported
data rate per UE for integrity protection.

NOTE 3: Reasons to reject a PDU Session Establishment request can e.g.
be that the UP Integrity Protection is determined to be \"Required\"
while the maximum supported data rate per UE for integrity protection is
less than the expected required data rate for the DN.

NOTE 4: The operator can take care to reduce the risk of such rejections
when configuring the subscribed User Plane Security Policy for a DNN.
For example, the operator may apply integrity protection \"Required\"
only in scenarios where it can be assumed that the UE maximum supported
data rate per UE for integrity protection is likely to be adequate for
the DN.

The User Plane Security Policy provide the same level of information
than User Plane Security Enforcement information.

User Plane Security Policy from UDM takes precedence over locally
configured User Plane Security Policy.

The User Plane Security Enforcement information may include the maximum
supported data rate for integrity protection provided by the UE, is
communicated from SMF to the NG-RAN for enforcement as part of PDU
session related information. If the UP Integrity Protection is
determined to be \"Required\" or \"Preferred\", the SMF also provides
the maximum supported data rate per UE for integrity protection as
received in the Integrity protection maximum data rate IE. This takes
place at establishment of a PDU Session or at activation of the user
plane of a PDU Session. The NG-RAN rejects the establishment of UP
resources for the PDU Session when it cannot fulfil User Plane Security
Enforcement information with a value of Required. The NG-RAN may also
take the maximum supported data rate per UE for integrity protection
into account in its decision on whether to accept or reject the
establishment of UP resources. In this case the SMF releases the PDU
Session. The NG-RAN notifies the SMF when it cannot fulfil a User Plane
Security Enforcement with a value of Preferred.

NOTE 5: For example, the NG-RAN cannot fulfil requirements in User Plane
Security Enforcement information with UP integrity protection set to
\"Required\" when it cannot negotiate UP integrity protection with the
UE.

It is responsibility of the NG-RAN to enforce that the maximum UP
integrity protection data rate delivered to the UE in downlink is not
exceeding the maximum supported data rate for integrity protection.

It is expected that generally the UP integrity protection data rate
applied by the UE in uplink will not exceed the indicated maximum
supported data rate, but the UE is not required to perform strict rate
enforcement.

User Plane Security Enforcement information and the maximum supported
data rate per UE for integrity protection is communicated from source to
target NG-RAN node at handover. If the target RAN node cannot support
requirements in User Plane Security Enforcement information, the target
RAN node rejects the request to setup resources for the PDU Session. In
this case the PDU Session is not handed over to the target RAN node and
the PDU Session is released.

If the UE or the new eNB or the MME does not indicate support of user
plane integrity protection with EPS, PDU Sessions with UP integrity
protection of the User Plane Security Enforcement information set to
Required are not transferred to EPS as follows:

\- In the case of mobility without N26, the SMF+PGW-C shall reject a PDN
connectivity request in EPS with handover indication if the UP integrity
protection of the User Plane Security Enforcement is set to Required.

NOTE 6: As described in clause 5.17.2.3.3, the UE does not know before
trying to move a given PDU Session to EPC, whether that PDU session can
be transferred to EPC.

\- In the case of idle mode and connected mode mobility with N26 to EPS,
or mobility without N26, the SMF+PGW-C ensures that the PDU session is
released.

If the UE, target eNB and the target MME indicate support of User Plane
Integrity Protection with EPS, PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection
of the User Plane Security Enforcement information set to Required are
transferred from 5GS to EPS according to existing procedures.

For the bearers of PDN Connections with UP integrity protection set to
Required, at (both idle mode and connected mode) mobility (including
intra-TA mobility) to an eNB that does not support User Plane Integrity
Protection with EPS, the MME shall inform the SMF+PGW-C and the
SMF+PGW-C ensures that the PDU session is released.

At connected mode mobility from EPS to GERAN/UTRAN or to a part of the
EPS that does not support User Plane Integrity Protection, the source
E-UTRAN shall ensure that EPS bearers with UP integrity protection of
the User Plane Security Enforcement information set to Required are not
handed over.

In the case of idle mode mobility from an MME that supports User Plane
Integrity Protection, to an MME that does not support User Plane
Integrity Protection, the (home) SMF+PGW-C shall trigger (e.g. based on
the lack of MME UPIP capability information) the release of the bearers
of PDN Connections with UP integrity protection set to Required.

At any (e.g. idle mode) mobility from EPS to GERAN/UTRAN, the (home)
SMF+PGW-C shall trigger (e.g. based on the received RAT Type) the
release of the bearers of PDN Connections with UP integrity protection
set to Required.

PDU Sessions with UP confidentiality protection of the User Plane
Security Enforcement information set to Required and UP integrity
protection of the User Plane Security Enforcement information not set to
Required, are allowed to be handed over to EPS regardless of how UP
confidentiality protection applies in EPS.

In the case of dual connectivity, the Integrity Protection is set to
\"Preferred\", the Master NG-RAN node may notify the SMF when it cannot
fulfil a User Plane Security Enforcement with a value of Preferred. The
SMF handling of the PDU session with respect to the Integrity Protection
status is up to SMF implementation decision.

## 5.11 Support for Dual Connectivity, Multi-Connectivity

### 5.11.1 Support for Dual Connectivity

Dual Connectivity involves two radio network nodes in providing radio
resources to a given UE (with active radio bearers), while a single N2
termination point exists for the UE between an AMF and the RAN. The RAN
architecture and related functions to support Dual Connectivity is
further described in RAN specifications (e.g. TS 37.340 \[31\]).

In this Release of the specification, the Dual Connectivity function
does not apply to the NR RedCap UE.

The RAN node at which the N2 terminates, performs all necessary N2
related functions such as mobility management, relaying of NAS
signalling, etc. and manages the handling of user plane connection (e.g.
transfer over N3). It is called the Master RAN Node. It may use
resources of another RAN node, the Secondary RAN node, to exchange User
Plane traffic of an UE. Master RAN node takes into account the RSN
and/or PDU Session Pair ID to determine if dual connectivity shall be
set up and ensure appropriate PDU session handling ensures fully
redundant user plane path as described in clause 5.33.2.1.

If the UE has Mobility Restriction (either signalled from the UDM, or,
locally generated by the Serving PLMN policy in the AMF) the AMF signals
these restrictions to the Master RAN Node as Mobility Restriction List;
This may prevent the Master RAN node from setting up a Dual Connectivity
for an UE.

NOTE 1: Subject to policies in the NG-RAN, configuration of Dual
Connectivity for a Data Radio Bearer can also be based on the Network
Slice that the PDU Session belongs to.

Dual Connectivity provides the possibility for the Master node RAN to
request SMF:

\- For some or all PDU Sessions of an UE: Direct all the DL User Plane
traffic of the PDU Session to the either the Master RAN Node or to the
Secondary RAN Node. In this case, there is a single N3 tunnel
termination at the RAN for such PDU Session.

NOTE 2: The terminating RAN Node, can decide to keep traffic for
specific QFI(s) in a PDU Session for a UE on a single RAT, or split them
across the two RATs.

\- For some other PDU Sessions of an UE: Direct the DL User Plane
traffic of some QoS Flows of the PDU Session to the Secondary
(respectively Master) RAN Node while the remaining QoS Flows of the PDU
Session are directed to the Master (respectively Secondary) RAN Node. In
this case there are, irrespective of the number of QoS Flows, two N3
tunnel terminations at the RAN for such PDU Session.

The Master RAN may create and change this assignment for the user plane
of a PDU Session at any time during the life time of the PDU Session;

In both cases, a single PDU Session Id is used to identify the PDU
Session.

Additional functional characteristics are:

\- User location information is based on the identity of the cell that
is serving the UE in the Master RAN node. The cell identity of the
Primary cell in the secondary RAN node may also be included. NG-RAN
includes the user location information in NGAP messages where the
contents of the user location information may change during the
corresponding procedure.

\- Path update signalling related with Dual Connectivity and UPF
re-allocation cannot occur at the same time.

## 5.12 Charging

### 5.12.1 General

5GC supports interactions towards CHF for network resource usage, as
defined in TS 32.240 \[41\]. The CHF and the Nchf service are defined in
TS 32.290 \[67\].

The SMF supports the interactions towards the CHF, as defined in
TS 32.255 \[68\]. The UPF supports functionality to collect and report
usage data to SMF. The N4 reference point supports the SMF control of
the UPF collection and reporting of usage data.

The AMF supports interactions towards the CHF, as defined in
TS 32.256 \[114\].

The SMSF supports interactions towards the CHF, as defined in
TS 32.274 \[118\].

The NEF supports interactions towards the CHF, as defined in
TS 32.254 \[123\].

### 5.12.2 Usage Data Reporting for Secondary RAT

When NG-RAN is deployed in dual connectivity configuration, the HPLMN or
VPLMN operator may wish to record the data volume sent and received on
the Secondary RAT.

In order to reduce the complexity of this procedure, the following
principles are used in this release:

a\) The PLMN locally activates the Secondary RAT Usage Data Reporting by
NG-RAN OAM. The activation is based on configuration in NG-RAN and
NG-RAN determines whether the data volume report will contain data
volumes consumed for the whole PDU Session or for selected QoS Flows or
both as described in TS 38.413 \[34\].

The activation can happen separately for Data Volume Reporting of NR in
licensed or unlicensed spectrum and E-UTRA in licensed or unlicensed
spectrum. If the PLMN uses this feature, it should ensure that this
functionality is supported by all NG-RAN nodes that support NR or E-UTRA
as a Secondary RAT.

b\) Depending on its configuration the NG-RAN reports uplink and
downlink data volumes to the 5GC for the Secondary RAT (including the
using of unlicensed spectrum for NR or E-UTRA) for the PDU Session or
for selected QoS Flows or both and per time interval.

c\) During Xn handover and N2 handover, the source NG-RAN node reports
the data volume to the 5GC. The reported data volume excludes data
forwarded to the target RAN node.

d\) At the time of NG connection release, Secondary Node change/release,
deactivation of UP connection for a PDU Session, the NG-RAN node reports
the data volumes to the 5GC.

e\) To assist \"partial CDR\" generation, NG-RAN OAM can instruct the
NG-RAN to also make periodic reports (as described in clause 5.12.3) if
no event has triggered a report before the period expires.

NOTE 2: The timing of these periodic NG-RAN reports is not expected to
align with the timing of partial CDR generation. Hence the frequency of
NG-RAN reports might be greater than that of partial CDR generation.

NOTE 3: RAN needs to be able to partition the measurements in a report
to indicate usage that occurred before and after an absolute time. An
example of the absolute time is that RAN is configured to partition data
usage reports that occurred before and after midnight.

### 5.12.3 Secondary RAT Periodic Usage Data Reporting Procedure

Periodic reporting of the Secondary RAT usage data is an optional
function. When NG-RAN, as defined in bullet e) of clause 5.12.12, is
configured with a \"time interval for Secondary RAT usage data
reporting\", the NG-RAN shall send a RAN Usage Data Report message for
periodic reporting purposes to the SMF only when the timer expires for a
UE for which Secondary RAT usage data reporting is ongoing. The timer
runs from the last usage reporting for the UE.

## 5.13 Support for Edge Computing

Edge computing enables operator and 3rd party services to be hosted
close to the UE\'s access point of attachment, so as to achieve an
efficient service delivery through the reduced end-to-end latency and
load on the transport network. Edge Computing support by 5GC is
specified in this specification and in TS 23.548 \[130\].

NOTE: Edge Computing typically applies to non-roaming and LBO roaming
scenarios.

The 5G Core Network selects a UPF close to the UE and forwards traffic
to enable the local access to the DN via a N6 interface according to the
provided traffic steering rules to the UPF. This may be based on the
UE\'s subscription data, UE location, the information from Application
Function (AF) as defined in clause 5.6.7, the EAS information reported
from EASDF (as defined in TS 23.548 \[130\]), policy or other related
traffic rules.

Due to user or Application Function mobility, the service or session
continuity may be required based on the requirements of the service or
the 5G network.

The 5G Core Network may expose network information and capabilities to
an Edge Computing Application Function.

NOTE: Depending on the operator deployment, certain Application
Functions can be allowed to interact directly with the Control Plane
Network Functions with which they need to interact, while the other
Application Functions need to use the external exposure framework via
the NEF (see clause 6.2.10 for details).

Edge computing can be supported by one or a combination of the following
enablers:

\- User plane (re)selection: the 5G Core Network (re)selects UPF to
route the user traffic to the local part of the DN as described in
clause 6.3.3;

\- Local Routing and Traffic Steering: the 5G Core Network selects the
traffic to be routed to the applications in the local part of the DN;

\- this includes the use of a single PDU Session with multiple PDU
Session Anchor(s) (UL CL / IP v6 multi-homing) as described in
clause 5.6.4 and the use of a PDU Session with Distributed Anchor Point
using SSC mode 2/3.

\- Session and service continuity to enable UE and application mobility
as described in clause 5.6.9;

\- An Application Function may influence UPF (re)selection and traffic
routing via PCF or NEF as described in clause 5.6.7;

\- Network capability exposure: 5G Core Network and Application Function
to provide information to each other via NEF as described in clause 5.20
or directly as described in clause 4.15 of TS 23.502 \[3\] or from the
UPF as described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.548 \[130\];

\- QoS and Charging: PCF provides rules for QoS Control and Charging for
the traffic routed to the local part of the DN;

\- Support of Local Area Data Network: 5G Core Network provides support
to connect to the LADN in a certain area where the applications are
deployed as described in clause 5.6.5.

\- Discovery and re-discovery of Edge Applications Servers as described
in TS 23.548 \[130\].

\- Support of Edge Relocation as described in TS 23.548 \[130\] and the
case of involving AF change as described in clauses 4.3.6.2, 4.3.6.3 and
4.3.6.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- Support of (I-)SMF (re)selection based on DNAI as described in
clauses 4.3.5.1, 4.3.5.2 and 4.23.5.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

## 5.14 Policy Control

The policy and charging control framework for the 5G System is defined
in TS 23.503 \[45\].

## 5.15 Network slicing

### 5.15.1 General

A Network Slice instance is defined within a PLMN or within an SNPN and
shall include:

\- the Core Network Control Plane and User Plane Network Functions, as
described in clause 4.2,

and, in the serving PLMN, at least one of the following:

\- the NG-RAN described in TS 38.300 \[27\];

\- the N3IWF or TNGF functions to the non-3GPP Access Network described
in clause 4.2.8.2 or the TWIF functions to the trusted WLAN in the case
of support of N5CW devices described in clause 4.2.8.5;

\- the W-AGF function to the Wireline Access Network described in
clause 4.2.8.4.

The 5G System deployed in a PLMN shall always support the procedures,
information and configurations specified to support Network Slice
instance selection in the present document, TS 23.502 \[3\] and
TS 23.503 \[45\].

Network slicing support for roaming is described in clause 5.15.6.

Network slices may differ for supported features and network functions
optimisations, in which case such Network Slices may have e.g. different
S-NSSAIs with different Slice/Service Types (see clause 5.15.2.1). The
operator can deploy multiple Network Slices delivering exactly the same
features but for different groups of UEs, e.g. as they deliver a
different committed service and/or because they are dedicated to a
customer, in which case such Network Slices may have e.g. different
S-NSSAIs with the same Slice/Service Type but different Slice
Differentiators (see clause 5.15.2.1).

The network may serve a single UE with one or more Network Slice
instances simultaneously via a 5G-AN regardless of the access type(s)
over which the UE is registered (i.e. 3GPP Access and/or N3GPP Access).
The AMF instance serving the UE logically belongs to each of the Network
Slice instances serving the UE, i.e. this AMF instance is common to the
Network Slice instances serving a UE.

NOTE 1: Number of simultaneous connection of Network Slice instances per
UE is limited by the number of S-NSSAIs in the Requested/Allowed NSSAI
as described in clause 5.15.2.1.

NOTE 2: In this Release of the specification it is assumed that in any
(home or visited) PLMN it is always possible to select an AMF that can
serve any combination of S-NSSAIs that will be provided as an Allowed
NSSAI.

The selection of the set of Network Slice instances for a UE is
triggered by the first contacted AMF in a Registration procedure
normally by interacting with the NSSF, and can lead to a change of AMF.
This is further described in clause 5.15.5.

A PDU Session belongs to one and only one specific Network Slice
instance per PLMN. Different Network Slice instances do not share a PDU
Session, though different Network Slice instances may have
slice-specific PDU Sessions using the same DNN.

During the Handover procedure the source AMF selects a target AMF by
interacting with the NRF as specified in clause 6.3.5.

Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA) enables
Network Slice specific authentication as described in clause 5.15.10.

Network Slice Admission Control (NSAC) controls the number of registered
UEs per network slice and the number of PDU Sessions per network slice
as described in clause 5.15.11.

Support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration
of network slices uses Network Slice Simultaneous Registration Group
(NSSRG) information to enable control of which Network Slices that can
be registered simultaneously by a UE as described in clause 5.15.12.

Support of data rate limitation per Network Slice for a UE enables
enforcement of Maximum Bit Rate per Network Slice for a UE as described
in clause 5.15.13.

### 5.15.2 Identification and selection of a Network Slice: the S-NSSAI and the NSSAI

#### 5.15.2.1 General

An S-NSSAI identifies a Network Slice.

An S-NSSAI is comprised of:

\- A Slice/Service type (SST), which refers to the expected Network
Slice behaviour in terms of features and services;

\- A Slice Differentiator (SD), which is optional information that
complements the Slice/Service type(s) to differentiate amongst multiple
Network Slices of the same Slice/Service type.

An S-NSSAI can have standard values (i.e. such S-NSSAI is only comprised
of an SST with a standardised SST value, see clause 5.15.2.2, and no SD)
or non-standard values (i.e. such S-NSSAI is comprised of either both an
SST and an SD or only an SST without a standardised SST value and no
SD). An S-NSSAI with a non-standard value identifies a single Network
Slice within the PLMN with which it is associated. An S-NSSAI with a
non-standard value shall not be used by the UE in access stratum
procedures in any PLMN other than the one to which the S-NSSAI is
associated.

The S-NSSAIs in the NSSP of the URSP rules (see clause 6.6.2 of
TS 23.503 \[45\]) and in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs (see clause 5.15.3)
contain only HPLMN S-NSSAI values.

The S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI, the Allowed NSSAI (see
clause 5.15.4.1), the Requested NSSAI (see clause 5.15.5.2.1), the
Rejected S-NSSAIs contain only values from the Serving PLMN. The Serving
PLMN can be the HPLMN or a VPLMN.

The S-NSSAI(s) in the PDU Session Establishment contain one Serving PLMN
S-NSSAI value and in addition may contain a corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI
value to which this first value is mapped (see clause 5.15.5.3).

The optional mapping of Serving PLMN S-NSSAIs to HPLMN S-NSSAIs contains
Serving PLMN S-NSSAI values and corresponding mapped HPLMN S-NSSAI
values.

The NSSAI is a collection of S-NSSAIs. An NSSAI may be a Configured
NSSAI, a Requested NSSAI or an Allowed NSSAI. There can be at most eight
S-NSSAIs in Allowed and Requested NSSAIs sent in signalling messages
between the UE and the Network. The Requested NSSAI signalled by the UE
to the network allows the network to select the Serving AMF, Network
Slice(s) and Network Slice instance(s) for this UE, as specified in
clause 5.15.5.

Based on the operator\'s operational or deployment needs, a Network
Slice instance can be associated with one or more S-NSSAIs, and an
S-NSSAI can be associated with one or more Network Slice instances.
Multiple Network Slice instances associated with the same S-NSSAI may be
deployed in the same or in different Tracking Areas. When multiple
Network Slice instances associated with the same S-NSSAI are deployed in
the same Tracking Areas, the AMF instance serving the UE may logically
belong to (i.e. be common to) more than one Network Slice instance
associated with this S-NSSAI.

In a PLMN, when an S-NSSAI is associated with more than one Network
Slice instance, one of these Network Slice instances, as a result of the
Network Slice instance selection procedure defined in clause 5.15.5,
serves a UE that is allowed to use this S-NSSAI. For any S-NSSAI, the
network may at any one time serve the UE with only one Network Slice
instance associated with this S-NSSAI until cases occur where e.g. this
Network Slice instance is no longer valid in a given Registration Area,
or a change in UE\'s Allowed NSSAI occurs, etc. In such cases,
procedures mentioned in clause 5.15.5.2.2 or clause 5.15.5.2.3 apply.

Based on the Requested NSSAI (if any) and the Subscription Information,
the 5GC is responsible for selection of a Network Slice instance(s) to
serve a UE including the 5GC Control Plane and User Plane Network
Functions corresponding to this Network Slice instance(s). The
Subscription Information may contain restrictions to the simultaneous
registration of network slices. This is provided to the serving AMF as
part of the UE subscription, in the form of Network Slice Simultaneous
Registration Group (NSSRG) information (see clause 5.15.12).

The (R)AN may use Requested NSSAI in access stratum signalling to handle
the UE Control Plane connection before the 5GC informs the (R)AN of the
Allowed NSSAI. The Requested NSSAI is used by the RAN for AMF selection,
as described in clause 6.3.5. The UE shall not include the Requested
NSSAI in the RRC Resume when the UE asks to resume the RRC connection
and is CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state.

When a UE is successfully registered over an Access Type, the CN informs
the (R)AN by providing the Allowed NSSAI for the corresponding Access
Type.

NOTE: The details of how the RAN uses NSSAI information are described in
TS 38.300 \[27\].

#### 5.15.2.2 Standardised SST values

Standardized SST values provide a way for establishing global
interoperability for slicing so that PLMNs can support the roaming use
case more efficiently for the most commonly used Slice/Service Types.

The SSTs which are standardised are in the following Table 5.15.2.2-1.

Table 5.15.2.2-1: Standardised SST values

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Slice/Service type     SST     Characteristics
                         value   
  ---------------------- ------- -----------------------------------------
  eMBB                   1       Slice suitable for the handling of 5G
                                 enhanced Mobile Broadband.

  URLLC                  2       Slice suitable for the handling of ultra-
                                 reliable low latency communications.

  MIoT                   3       Slice suitable for the handling of

  V2X                    4       Slice suitable for the handling of V2X
                                 services.

  HMTC                   5       Slice suitable for the handling of
                                 High-Performance Machine-Type
                                 Communications.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1: The support of all standardised SST values is not required in a
PLMN. Services indicated in this table for each SST value can also be
supported by means of other SSTs.

NOTE 2: A mapping of GSMA defined Network Slice Types (NEST) to standard
SST values is defined in GSMA NG.116 \[137\].

### 5.15.3 Subscription aspects

The Subscription Information shall contain one or more S-NSSAIs i.e.
Subscribed S-NSSAIs. The subscription information shall include at least
one default S-NSSAI. The UDM sends at the most 16 Subscribed S-NSSAIs to
AMF, i.e. the number that can fit in a Configured NSSAI. The
subscription information the UDM sends to the AMF shall include at least
one default S-NSSAI.

If an S-NSSAI is marked as default, then the network is expected to
serve the UE with a related applicable Network Slice instance when the
UE does not send any permitted S-NSSAI to the network in a Registration
Request message as part of the Requested NSSAI.

The Subscription Information for each S-NSSAI may contain:

\- a Subscribed DNN list and one default DNN; and

\- the indication whether the S-NSSAI is marked as default Subscribed
S-NSSAI; and

\- the indication whether the S-NSSAI is subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization; and

\- Network Slice Simultaneous Usage Group (NSSRG) information (see
clause 5.15.12).

The network verifies the Requested NSSAI the UE provides in the
Registration Request against the Subscription Information. For the
S-NSSAIs subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization the clause 5.15.10 applies.

NOTE 1: It is recommended that at least one of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs
marked as default S-NSSAI is not subject to Network Slice-specific
Authentication and Authorization, in order to ensure access to services
even when Network Slice-specific Authentication and Authorization fails.

NOTE 2: It is recommended to minimize the number of Subscribed S-NSSAIs
in subscriptions for NB-IoT or NR RedCap capable UEs to minimize
overhead for signalling a large number of S-NSSAIs in Requested NSSAI in
RRC and NAS via NB-IoT or NR RedCap.

In roaming case, the UDM shall provide to the VPLMN only the S-NSSAIs
from the Subscribed S-NSSAIs the HPLMN allows for the UE in the VPLMN.
If the UE is subject to restrictions of simultaneous registration of
network slices (i.e. if the Subscription Information for the S-NSSAIs
contains NSSRG information), the UDM provides to the VPLMN a subscribed
S-NSSAIs and, if applicable, NSSRG information, as described in
clause 5.15.12.

NOTE 3: Network slice instances supporting an S-NSSAI subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization need to be deployed with
AMFs supporting Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization,
otherwise S-NSSAIs requiring Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization would be incorrectly allowed without execution of Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization.

NOTE 4: Network slice instances supporting an S-NSSAI subject to Network
Slice Admission Control (NSAC) need to be deployed with AMFs supporting
NSAC, otherwise S-NSSAIs requiring NSAC would be incorrectly allowed
without execution of NSAC.

When the UDM updates the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) to the serving AMF, based
on configuration in this AMF, the AMF itself or the NSSF determines the
mapping of the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and/or Allowed
NSSAI to the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s). The serving AMF then updates the UE
with the above information as described in clause 5.15.4.

### 5.15.4 UE NSSAI configuration and NSSAI storage aspects

#### 5.15.4.1 General

##### 5.15.4.1.1 UE Network Slice configuration

The Network Slice configuration information contains one or more
Configured NSSAI(s). A Configured NSSAI may either be configured by a
Serving PLMN and apply to the Serving PLMN, or may be a Default
Configured NSSAI configured by the HPLMN and that applies to any PLMNs
for which no specific Configured NSSAI has been provided to the UE.
There is at most one Configured NSSAI per PLMN.

NOTE 1: The value(s) used in the Default Configured NSSAI are expected
to be commonly decided by all roaming partners, e.g. by the use of
values standardized by 3GPP or other bodies.

The Default Configured NSSAI, if it is configured in the UE, is used by
the UE in a Serving PLMN only if the UE has no Configured NSSAI for the
Serving PLMN.

The Configured NSSAI of a PLMN may include S-NSSAIs that have standard
values or PLMN-specific values.

The Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN includes the S-NSSAI values
which can be used in the Serving PLMN and may be associated with mapping
of each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI to one or more corresponding
HPLMN S-NSSAI values.

A UE subscription may contain Network Slice Simultaneous Registration
Group (NSSRG) information. If so, the UE configuration is performed as
described in clause 5.15.12.2.

The UE may be pre-configured with the Default Configured NSSAI. The UE
may be provisioned/updated with the Default Configured NSSAI, determined
by the UDM in the HPLMN, using the UE Parameters Update via UDM Control
Plane procedure defined in clause 4.20 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. Each S-NSSAI
in the Default Configured NSSAI may have a corresponding S-NSSAI as part
of the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s). Consequently, if the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s)
which are also present in the Default Configured NSSAI are updated the
UDM should update the Default Configured NSSAI in the UE.

In the HPLMN, the S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI provided as described
in clause 5.15.4.2, at the time when they are provided to the UE, shall
match the Subscribed S-NSSAIs for the UE. When the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s)
are updated (i.e. some existing S-NSSAIs are removed and/or some new
S-NSSAIs are added) and one or more are applicable to the Serving PLMN
the UE is registered in, as described in clause 5.15.3, or when the
associated mapping is updated the AMF shall update the UE with the
Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and/or Allowed NSSAI and/or the
associated mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs (see clause 5.15.4.2). When there
is the need to update the Allowed NSSAI, the AMF shall provide the UE
with the new Allowed NSSAI and the associated mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs,
unless the AMF cannot determine the new Allowed NSSAI (e.g. all S-NSSAIs
in the old Allowed NSSAI have been removed from the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs), in which case the AMF shall not send any Allowed NSSAI to the
UE but indicate to the UE to perform a Registration procedure. If the UE
is in a CM-IDLE state, the AMF may trigger Network Triggered Service
Request or wait until the UE is in a CM-CONNECTED state as described in
clause 4.2.4.2, TS 23.502 \[3\].

When providing a Requested NSSAI to the network upon registration, the
UE in a given PLMN only includes and uses S-NSSAIs applying to this
PLMN. The mapping of S-NSSAIs of the Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs
may also be provided (see clause 5.15.4.1.2 for when this is needed).
The S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI are part of the Configured and/or
Allowed NSSAIs applicable for this PLMN, when they are available. If the
UE has received NSSRG information together with the Configured NSSAI, it
only includes in the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that all share a common
NSSRG. If no Configured NSSAI and Allowed NSSAI for the PLMN are
available, the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI correspond to the Default
Configured NSSAI, if configured in the UE. Upon successful completion of
a UE\'s Registration procedure over an Access Type, the UE obtains from
the AMF an Allowed NSSAI for this Access Type, which includes one or
more S-NSSAIs and, if needed (see clause 5.15.4.1.2 for when this is
needed), their mapping to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs. These S-NSSAIs are valid
for the current Registration Area and Access Type provided by the AMF
the UE has registered with and can be used simultaneously by the UE (up
to the maximum number of simultaneous Network Slice instances or PDU
Sessions).

The UE might also obtain one or more rejected S-NSSAIs with cause and
validity of rejection from the AMF. An S-NSSAI may be rejected:

\- for the entire PLMN; or

\- for the current Registration Area.

While it remains RM-REGISTERED in the PLMN and regardless of the Access
Type, the UE shall not re-attempt to register to an S-NSSAI rejected for
the entire PLMN until this rejected S-NSSAI is deleted as specified
below.

While it remains RM-REGISTERED in the PLMN, the UE shall not re-attempt
to register to an S-NSSAI rejected in the current Registration Area
until it moves out of the current Registration Area.

NOTE 2: The details and more cases of S-NSSAI rejection are described in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

S-NSSAIs that the UE provides in the Requested NSSAI which are neither
in the Allowed NSSAI nor provided as a rejected S-NSSAI, shall, by the
UE, not be regarded as rejected, i.e. the UE may request to register
these S-NSSAIs again next time the UE sends a Requested NSSAI.

The UE stores (S-)NSSAIs as follows:

\- When provisioned with a Configured NSSAI for a PLMN and/or a mapping
of Configured NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and possibly NSSRG information for
each S-NSSAI in the Configured NSSAI (if applicable and supported by the
UE), or when requested to remove the configuration due to network
slicing subscription change, the UE shall:

\- replace any stored (old) Configured NSSAI for this PLMN with the new
Configured NSSAI for this PLMN (if applicable); and

\- delete any stored associated mapping of this old Configured NSSAI for
this PLMN to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and, if present and applicable, store the
mapping of Configured NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs; and

\- delete any stored associated NSSRG information for each S-NSSAI of
the Configured NSSAI and, if present, store the associated NSSRG
information for each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI; and

\- delete any stored rejected S-NSSAI for this PLMN;

\- keep the received Configured NSSAI for a PLMN (if applicable) and
associated mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs (if applicable) and associated
NSSRG information for each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI (if
applicable and supported by the UE) stored in the UE, even when
registering in another PLMN, until a new Configured NSSAI for this PLMN
and/or associated mapping are provisioned in the UE, or until the
network slicing subscription changes, as described in clause 5.15.4.2.
The number of Configured NSSAIs and associated mapping to be kept stored
in the UE for PLMNs other than the HPLMN is up to UE implementation. A
UE shall at least be capable of storing a Configured NSSAI for the
serving PLMN including any necessary mapping of the Configured NSSAI for
the Serving PLMN to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and the Default Configured NSSAI.

\- The Allowed NSSAI received in a Registration Accept message or a UE
Configuration Update Command applies to a PLMN when at least a TAI of
this PLMN is included in the RA/TAI list included in this Registration
Accept message or UE Configuration Update Command. If the UE
Configuration Update Command contains an Allowed NSSAI but not a TAI
List, then the last received RA/TAI list applies for the decision on
which PLMN(s) the Allowed NSSAI is applicable. If received, the Allowed
NSSAI for a PLMN and Access Type and any associated mapping of this
Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs shall be stored in the UE. The UE should
store this Allowed NSSAI and any associated mapping of this Allowed
NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs also when the UE is turned off, or until the
network slicing subscription changes, as described in clause 5.15.4.2:

NOTE 3: Whether the UE stores the Allowed NSSAI and any associated
mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs also when the UE is
turned off is left to UE implementation.

\- When a new Allowed NSSAI for a PLMN and any associated mapping of the
Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs are received over an Access Type, the UE
shall:

\- replace any stored (old) Allowed NSSAI and any associated mapping for
these PLMN and Access Type with this new Allowed NSSAI; and

\- delete any stored associated mapping of this old Allowed NSSAI for
this PLMN to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and, if present, store the associated
mapping of this new Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs;

\- If received, an S-NSSAI rejected for the entire PLMN shall be stored
in the UE while RM-REGISTERED in this PLMN regardless of the Access Type
or until it is deleted.

\- If received, an S-NSSAI rejected for the current Registration Area
shall be stored in the UE while RM-REGISTERED until the UE moves out of
the current Registration Area or until the S-NSSAI is deleted.

NOTE 4: The storage aspects of rejected S-NSSAIs are described in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

\- If received, the Pending NSSAI shall be stored in the UE as described
in TS 24.501 \[47\].

##### 5.15.4.1.2 Mapping of S-NSSAIs values in the Allowed NSSAI and in the Requested NSSAI to the S-NSSAIs values used in the HPLMN

One or more S-NSSAIs in an Allowed NSSAI provided to the UE can have
values which are not part of the UE\'s current Network Slice
configuration information for the Serving PLMN. In this case, the
network provides the Allowed NSSAI together with the mapping of each
S-NSSAI of the Allowed NSSAI to the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN.
This mapping information allows the UE to associate Applications to
S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN as per NSSP of the URSP rules or as per the UE
Local Configuration (if available), as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of
TS 23.503 \[45\] and to the corresponding S-NSSAI from the Allowed
NSSAI.

In roaming case, the UE may need to provide the mapping of S-NSSAIs
values in the Requested NSSAI to the corresponding S-NSSAI values used
in the HPLMN. These values are found in the mapping previously received
from the Serving PLMN of the S-NSSAIs of the Configured NSSAI for the
Serving PLMN or of the S-NSSAIs of the Allowed NSSAI for the Serving
PLMN and Access Type to the corresponding S-NSSAIs values used in the
HPLMN.

#### 5.15.4.2 Update of UE Network Slice configuration

At any time, the AMF may provide the UE with a new Configured NSSAI for
the Serving PLMN, associated with mapping of the Configured NSSAI to
HPLMN S-NSSAIs as specified in clause 5.15.4.1. The Configured NSSAI for
the Serving PLMN and the mapping information is either determined in the
AMF (if based on configuration, the AMF is allowed to determine the
Network Slice configuration for the whole PLMN) or by the NSSF. The AMF
provides an updated Configured NSSAI as specified in clause 4.2.4 of
TS 23.502 \[3\], UE Configuration Update procedure.

The AMF shall provide the UE with NSSRG information alongside the
Configured NSSAI if NSSRG information is included in the subscription
information received from the UDM and if the UE has indicated support
for the feature as part of the registration request, see clause 5.15.12.

If the HPLMN performs the configuration update of a UE registered in the
HPLMN (e.g. due to a change in the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) or due to a
change of NSSRG information), this results in updates to the Configured
NSSAI for the HPLMN and, if applicable, NSSRG information for each
S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI. Updates to the Allowed NSSAI and/or, if
present, to the associated mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN
S-NSSAIs are also possible if the configuration update affects
S-NSSAI(s) in the current Allowed NSSAI.

If the VPLMN performs the configuration update of a UE registered in the
VPLMN (e.g. due to a change in the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s), the associated
mapping is updated, or due to a change of NSSRG information), this
results in updates to the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and/or
to the associated mapping of the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN
to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and, if applicable, NSSRG information for each S-NSSAI
of the Configured NSSAI. Updates to the Allowed NSSAI and/or to the
associated mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs are also
possible if the configuration update affects S-NSSAI(s) in the current
Allowed NSSAI.

A UE for which the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN has been
updated as described in clause 5.15.4.1 and has been requested to
perform a Registration procedure, shall initiate a Registration
procedure to receive a new valid Allowed NSSAI (see clause 5.15.5.2.2).

When the subscribed S-NSSAIs change, a UDR flag is set in the HPLMN to
make sure the current PLMN (or, if the UE was not reachable, the next
serving PLMN) is informed by the UDM that the subscription data for
network slicing has changed. The AMF, when it receives the indication
from the UDM subscription has changed, indicates the UE that
subscription has changed and uses any updated subscription information
from the UDM to update the UE. Once the AMF updates the UE and obtains
an acknowledgment from the UE, the AMF informs the UDM that the
configuration update was successful and the UDM clears the flag in the
UDR. If the UE is in a CM-IDLE state, the AMF may trigger Network
Triggered Service Request or wait until the UE is in a CM-CONNECTED
state as described in clause 4.2.4.2, TS 23.502 \[3\].

If the UE receives indication from the AMF that Network Slicing
subscription has changed, the UE locally deletes the network slicing
information it has for all PLMNs, except the Default Configured NSSAI
(if present). It also updates the current PLMN network slicing
configuration information with any received values from the AMF.

The update of URSP rules (which include the NSSP), if necessary at any
time, is described in TS 23.503 \[45\].

### 5.15.5 Detailed Operation Overview

#### 5.15.5.1 General

The establishment of User Plane connectivity to a Data Network via a
Network Slice instance(s) comprises two steps:

\- performing a RM procedure to select an AMF that supports the required
Network Slices.

\- establishing one or more PDU Session to the required Data network via
the Network Slice instance(s).

#### 5.15.5.2 Selection of a Serving AMF supporting the Network Slices

##### 5.15.5.2.1 Registration to a set of Network Slices

When a UE registers over an Access Type with a PLMN, if the UE has
either or both of:

\- a Configured NSSAI for this PLMN;

\- an Allowed NSSAI for this PLMN and Access Type;

the UE shall provide to the network, in AS layer under the conditions
described in clause 5.15.9 and in NAS layer, a Requested NSSAI
containing the S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to the Network Slice(s) to which
the UE wishes to register, unless they are stored in the UE in the
Pending NSSAI.

The Requested NSSAI shall be one of:

\- the Default Configured NSSAI, i.e. if the UE has no Configured NSSAI
nor an Allowed NSSAI for the serving PLMN;

\- the Configured-NSSAI, or a subset thereof as described below, e.g. if
the UE has no Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type for the serving PLMN;

\- the Allowed-NSSAI for the Access Type over which the Requested NSSAI
is sent, or a subset thereof; or

\- the Allowed-NSSAI for the Access Type over which the Requested NSSAI
is sent, or a subset thereof, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the
Configured-NSSAI not yet in the Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type as
described below.

NOTE 1: If the UE wishes to register only a subset of the S-NSSAIs from
the Configured NSSAI or the Allowed NSSAI, to be able to register with
some Network Slices e.g. to establish PDU Sessions for some
application(s), and the UE uses the URSP rules (which includes the NSSP)
or the UE Local Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of
TS 23.503 \[45\], then the UE uses applicable the URSP rules or the UE
Local Configuration to ensure that the S-NSSAIs included in the
Requested NSSAI are not in conflict with the URSP rules or with the UE
Local Configuration.

The subset of S-NSSAIs in the Configured-NSSAI provided in the Requested
NSSAI consists of one or more S-NSSAI(s) in the Configured NSSAI
applicable to this PLMN, if one is present, and for which no
corresponding S-NSSAI is already present in the Allowed NSSAI for the
access type for this PLMN. The UE shall not include in the Requested
NSSAI any S-NSSAI that is currently rejected by the network (i.e.
rejected in the current registration area or rejected in the PLMN). For
the registration to a PLMN for which neither a Configured NSSAI
applicable to this PLMN or an Allowed NSSAI are present, the S-NSSAIs
provided in the Requested NSSAI correspond to the S-NSSAI(s) in the
Default Configured NSSAI unless the UE has HPLMN S-NSSAI for established
PDU Session(s) in which case the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) shall be provided in
the mapping of Requested NSSAI in the NAS Registration Request message,
with no corresponding VPLMN S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI. If the UE
has been provided with NSSRG information together with the Configured
NSSAI, the UE only includes in the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a
common NSSRG, see clause 5.15.12.2.

When a UE registers over an Access Type with a PLMN, the UE shall also
indicate in the Registration Request message when the Requested NSSAI is
based on the Default Configured NSSAI.

The UE shall include the Requested NSSAI in the RRC Connection
Establishment and in the establishment of the connection to the
N3IWF/TNGF (as applicable) and in the NAS Registration procedure
messages subject to conditions set out in clause 5.15.9. However, the UE
shall not indicate any NSSAI in RRC Connection Establishment or Initial
NAS message unless it has either a Configured NSSAI for the
corresponding PLMN, an Allowed NSSAI for the corresponding PLMN and
Access Type, or the Default Configured NSSAI. If the UE has HPLMN
S-NSSAI(s) for established PDU Session(s), the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) shall be
provided in the mapping of Requested NSSAI in the NAS Registration
Request message, independent of whether the UE has the corresponding
VPLMN S-NSSAI. The (R)AN shall route the NAS signalling between this UE
and an AMF selected using the Requested NSSAI obtained during RRC
Connection Establishment or connection to N3IWF/TNGF respectively. If
the (R)AN is unable to select an AMF based on the Requested NSSAI, it
routes the NAS signalling to an AMF from a set of default AMFs. In the
NAS signalling, if available, the UE provides the mapping of each
S-NSSAI of the Requested NSSAI to a corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI.

When a UE registers with a PLMN, if for this PLMN the UE has not
included a Requested NSSAI nor a GUAMI while establishing the connection
to the (R)AN, the (R)AN shall route all NAS signalling from/to this UE
to/from a default AMF. When receiving from the UE a Requested NSSAI and
a 5G-S-TMSI or a GUAMI in RRC Connection Establishment or in the
establishment of connection to N3IWF/TNGF, if the 5G-AN can reach an AMF
corresponding to the 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI, then 5G-AN forwards the request
to this AMF. Otherwise, the 5G-AN selects a suitable AMF based on the
Requested NSSAI provided by the UE and forwards the request to the
selected AMF. If the 5G-AN is not able to select an AMF based on the
Requested NSSAI, then the request is sent to a default AMF.

When the AMF selected by the AN during Registration Procedure receives
the UE Registration request, or after an AMF selection by MME (i.e.
during EPS to 5GS handover) the AMF receives S-NSSAI(s) from SMF+PGW-C
in 5GC:

\- As part of the Registration procedure described in clause 4.2.2.2.2
of TS 23.502 \[3\], or as part of the EPS to 5GS handover using N26
interface procedure described in clause 4.11.1.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\],
the AMF may query the UDM to retrieve UE subscription information
including the Subscribed S-NSSAIs.

\- The AMF verifies whether the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI or the
S-NSSAI(s) received from SMF+PGW-C are permitted based on the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs (to identify the Subscribed S-NSSAIs the AMF may use the
mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs provided by the UE, in the NAS message, for
each S-NSSAI of the Requested NSSAI).

\- When the UE context in the AMF does not yet include an Allowed NSSAI
for the corresponding Access Type, the AMF queries the NSSF (see (B)
below for subsequent handling), except in the case when, based on
configuration in this AMF, the AMF is allowed to determine whether it
can serve the UE (see (A) below for subsequent handling). The IP address
or FQDN of the NSSF is locally configured in the AMF.

NOTE 2: The configuration in the AMF depends on operator\'s policy.

\- When the UE context in the AMF already includes an Allowed NSSAI for
the corresponding Access Type, based on the configuration for this AMF,
the AMF may be allowed to determine whether it can serve the UE (see (A)
below for subsequent handling).

\- AMF or NSSF may have previously subscribed to slice load level and/or
Observed Service Experience and/or Dispersion Analytics related network
data analytics for a Network Slice from NWDAF, optionally for an Area of
Interest composed of one or several TAIs. If AMF subscribes to
analytics, AMF may determine that it cannot serve the UE based on
received analytics (see (A) below). If AMF subscribes to notifications
on changes on the Network Slice or Network Slice instance availability
information from NSSF optionally indicating a list of supported TAIs, it
may determine that it cannot serve the UE after the restriction
notification is received (see (A) below). If AMF does not subscribe to
notifications on changes on the availability information from NSSF, NSSF
may take the analytics information into account when AMF queries NSSF
(see (B) below).

NOTE 3: The configuration in the AMF depends on the operator\'s policy.

**(A)** Depending on fulfilling the configuration as described above,
the AMF may be allowed to determine whether it can serve the UE, and the
following is performed:

\- For the mobility from EPS to 5GS, the AMF first derives the serving
PLMN value(s) of S-NSSAI(s) based on the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) in the mapping
of Requested NSSAI (in CM-IDLE state) or the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) received
from SMF+PGW-C (in CM-CONNECTED state). After that the AMF regards the
derived value(s) as the Requested NSSAI.

\- For the inter PLMN within 5GC mobility, the new AMF derives the
serving PLMN value(s) of S-NSSAI(s) based on the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) in the
mapping of Requested NSSAI. After that the AMF regards the derived
value(s) as the Requested NSSAI.

\- AMF checks whether it can serve all the S-NSSAI(s) from the Requested
NSSAI present in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs (potentially using
configuration for mapping S-NSSAI values between HPLMN and Serving
PLMN), or all the S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs in the case that no Requested NSSAI was provided or none of the
S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI are permitted, i.e. do not match any of
the Subscribed S-NSSAIs or not available at the current UE\'s Tracking
Area (see clause 5.15.3).

\- If AMF has subscribed to slice load level and/or Observed Service
Experience and/or Dispersion Analytics related network data analytics
for a Network Slice from NWDAF, or if AMF had received a Network Slice
restriction from NSSF that applies to the list of TAIs supported by the
AMF, it may use that information to determine whether the AMF can serve
the UE on the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI.

\- If the AMF can serve the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI, the AMF
remains the serving AMF for the UE. The Allowed NSSAI is then composed
of the list of S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI permitted based on the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs and/or the list of S-NSSAI(s) for the Serving PLMN
which are mapped to the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) provided in the mapping of
Requested NSSAI permitted based on the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, or, if
neither Requested NSSAI nor the mapping of Requested NSSAI was provided
or none of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI are permitted, all the
S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs and taking also
into account the availability of the Network Slice instances as
described in clause 5.15.8 that are able to serve the S-NSSAI(s) in the
Allowed NSSAI in the current UE\'s Tracking Areas in addition to any
Network Slice instance restriction for the S-NSSAI(s) in the Allowed
NSSAI provided by the NSSF. If the AMF has received NSSRG Information
for the Subscribed S-NSSAIs as part of the UE subscription information,
it shall only include in the Allowed NSSAI S-NSSAIs that all share a
common NSSRG (see clause 5.15.12). If at least one S-NSSAI in the
Requested NSSAI is not available in the current UE\'s Tracking Area,
then either the AMF may determine a Target NSSAI or step (B) is
executed. The AMF also determines the mapping if the S-NSSAI(s) included
in the Allowed NSSAI needs to be mapped to Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) values.
If no Requested NSSAI is provided, or the mapping of the S-NSSAIs in
Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs is incorrect, or the Requested NSSAI
includes an S-NSSAI that is not valid in the Serving PLMN, or the UE
indicated that the Requested NSSAI is based on the Default Configured
NSSAI, the AMF, based on the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) and operator\'s
configuration, may also determine the Configured NSSAI for the Serving
PLMN and, if applicable, the associated mapping of the Configured NSSAI
to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, so these can be configured in the UE. Then Step (C)
is executed.

\- Else, the AMF queries the NSSF (see (B) below).

**(B)** When required as described above, the AMF needs to query the
NSSF, and the following is performed:

\- The AMF queries the NSSF, with Requested NSSAI, Default Configured
NSSAI Indication, mapping of Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs (with an indication if marked as default S-NSSAI),
NSSRG Information (if provided by the UDM, see clause 5.15.12), any
Allowed NSSAI it might have for the other Access Type (including its
mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs), PLMN ID of the SUPI and UE\'s current
Tracking Area.

\- Based on this information, local configuration, and other locally
available information including RAN capabilities in the current Tracking
Area for the UE or load level information for a Network Slice instance
provided by the NWDAF, the NSSF does the following:

\- It verifies which S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are permitted
based on comparing the Subscribed S-NSSAIs with the S-NSSAIs in the
mapping of Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs. It considers the
S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs in the case that
no Requested NSSAI was provided or no S-NSSAI from the Requested NSSAI
are permitted i.e. are not present in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs or not
available e.g. at the current UE\'s Tracking Area. If NSSRG information
is provided, the NSSF only selects S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG
(see clause 5.15.12).

\- If AMF has not subscribed to notifications on changes on the Network
Slice or Network Slice instance availability information from NSSF and
NSSF has subscribed to slice load level and/or Observed Service
Experience and/or Dispersion Analytics related network data analytics
for a Network Slice from NWDAF, NSSF may use the analytics information
for the determination of the (Network Slice instance(s) and the) list of
S-NSSAI(s) in the Allowed NSSAI(s) to serve the UE.

\- It selects the Network Slice instance(s) to serve the UE. When
multiple Network Slice instances in the UE\'s Tracking Area are able to
serve a given S-NSSAI, based on operator\'s configuration, the NSSF may
select one of them to serve the UE, or the NSSF may defer the selection
of the Network Slice instance until a NF/service within the Network
Slice instance needs to be selected.

\- It determines the target AMF Set to be used to serve the UE, or,
based on configuration, the list of candidate AMF(s), possibly after
querying the NRF.

NOTE 4: If the target AMF(s) returned from the NSSF is the list of
candidate AMF(s), the Registration Request message can only be
redirected via the direct signalling between the initial AMF and the
selected target AMF as described in clause 5.15.5.2.3. The NSSF does not
provide the target AMF(s), when it provides a Target NSSAI in order to
redirect or handover the UE to a cell of another TA as described in
clause 5.3.4.3.3.

\- It determines the Allowed NSSAI(s) for the applicable Access Type,
composed of the list of S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI permitted
based on the Subscribed S-NSSAIs and/or the list of S-NSSAI(s) for the
Serving PLMN which are mapped to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs provided in the
mapping of Requested NSSAI permitted based on the Subscribed S-NSSAIs,
or, if neither Requested NSSAI nor the mapping of Requested NSSAI was
provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI are permitted,
all the S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, and
taking also into account the availability of the Network Slice instances
as described in clause 5.15.8 that are able to serve the S-NSSAI(s) in
the Allowed NSSAI in the current UE\'s Tracking Areas. If NSSRG
information applies, the NSSF only selects S-NSSAIs that share a common
NSSRG (see clause 5.15.12).

\- It also determines the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Allowed
NSSAI(s) to the Subscribed S-NSSAIs if necessary.

\- Based on operator configuration, the NSSF may determine the NRF(s) to
be used to select NFs/services within the selected Network Slice
instance(s).

\- Additional processing to determine the Allowed NSSAI(s) in roaming
scenarios and the mapping to the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, as described in
clause 5.15.6.

\- If no Requested NSSAI is provided or the Requested NSSAI includes an
S-NSSAI that is not valid in the Serving PLMN, or the mapping of the
S-NSSAIs in Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs is incorrect, or the
Default Configured NSSAI Indication is received from AMF, the NSSF based
on the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) and operator configuration may also
determine the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and, if applicable,
the associated mapping of the Configured NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, so
these can be configured in the UE.

\- If at least one S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI is not available in
the current UE\'s Tracking Area, the NSSF may provide a Target NSSAI for
the purpose of allowing the NG-RAN to redirect the UE to a cell of a TA
in another frequency band supporting network slices not available in the
current TA as described in clause 5.3.4.3.3.

\- The NSSF returns to the current AMF the Allowed NSSAI for the
applicable Access Type, the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Allowed NSSAI
to the Subscribed S-NSSAIs if determined and the target AMF Set, or,
based on configuration, the list of candidate AMF(s). The NSSF may
return the NRF(s) to be used to select NFs/services within the selected
Network Slice instance(s), and the NRF to be used to determine the list
of candidate AMF(s) from the AMF Set. The NSSF may return NSI ID(s) to
be associated to the Network Slice instance(s) corresponding to certain
S-NSSAIs. NSSF may return the rejected S-NSSAI(s) as described in
clause 5.15.4.1. The NSSF may return the Configured NSSAI for the
Serving PLMN and the associated mapping of the Configured NSSAI to HPLMN
S-NSSAIs. The NSSF may return Target NSSAI as described in
clause 5.3.4.3.3.

\- Depending on the available information and based on configuration,
the AMF may query the appropriate NRF (e.g. locally pre-configured or
provided by the NSSF) with the target AMF Set. The NRF returns a list of
candidate AMFs.

\- If AMF Re-allocation is necessary, the current AMF reroutes the
Registration Request or forwards the UE context to a target serving AMF
as described in clause 5.15.5.2.3.

\- Step (C) is executed.

**(C)** The serving AMF shall determine a Registration Area such that
all S-NSSAIs of the Allowed NSSAI for this Registration Area are
available in all Tracking Areas of the Registration Area (and also
considering other aspects as described in clause 5.3.2.3 and
clause 5.3.4.3.3) and then return to the UE this Allowed NSSAI and the
mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to the Subscribed S-NSSAIs if provided. The
AMF may return the rejected S-NSSAI(s) as described in clause 5.15.4.1.

NOTE 5: The S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI for Non-3GPP access are
available homogeneously in the PLMN for the N3IWF case. For other types
of Non 3GPP access the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI for Non-3GPP access
can be not available homogeneously all over the PLMN, for example
different W-AGFs can support different TAIs that support different
network slices.

When either no Requested NSSAI was included, or the mapping of the
S-NSSAIs in Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs is incorrect, or a
Requested NSSAI is not considered valid in the PLMN and as such at least
one S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI was rejected as not usable by the UE
in the PLMN, or the UE indicated that the Requested NSSAI is based on
the Default Configured NSSAI, the AMF may update the UE slice
configuration information for the PLMN as described in clause 5.15.4.2.

If the Requested NSSAI does not include S-NSSAIs which map to S-NSSAIs
of the HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization and the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in
the Allowed NSSAI for the UE in the current UE\'s Tracking Area and if
no default S-NSSAI(s) could be added as described in step (A), the AMF
shall reject the UE Registration and shall include in the rejection
message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate
rejection cause value.

If the Requested NSSAI includes S-NSSAIs which map to S-NSSAIs of the
HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization, the AMF shall include in the Registration Accept message
an Allowed NSSAI containing only those S-NSSAIs that are not to be
subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization and,
based on the UE Context in AMF, those S-NSSAIs for which Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for at least one of the
corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAIs succeeded previously regardless the Access
Type, if any.

The AMF shall also provide the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them
with the appropriate rejection cause value.

If the AMF determined the Target NSSAI or received a Target NSSAI from
the NSSF, the AMF should provide the Target NSSAI to the PCF for
retrieving a corresponding RFSP as described in clause 5.3.4.3.1 or, if
the PCF is not deployed, the AMF should determine a corresponding RFSP
based on local configuration. Then the AMF provides the Target NSSAI and
the corresponding RFSP to the NG-RAN as described in clause 5.3.4.3.3.
The S-NSSAIs which map to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN subject to an ongoing
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization shall be
included in the Pending NSSAI and removed from Allowed NSSAI. The
Pending NSSAI may contain a mapping of the S-NSSAI(s) for the Serving
PLMN to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs, if applicable. The UE shall not include in
the Requested NSSAI any of the S-NSSAIs from the Pending NSSAI the UE
stores, regardless of the Access Type.

If:

\- all the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are still to be subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization; or

\- no Requested NSSAI was provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the
Requested NSSAI matches any of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, and all the
S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs are to be
subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization;

the AMF shall provide a \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator and no
Allowed NSSAI to the UE in the Registration Accept message. Upon
receiving the Registration Accept message, the UE is registered in the
PLMN but shall wait for the completion of the Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization without attempting to use any service
provided by the PLMN on any access, except e.g. emergency services (see
TS 24.501 \[47\]), until the UE receives an allowed NSSAI.

Then, the AMF shall initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization procedure as described in clause 5.15.10 for each
S-NSSAI that requires it, except, based on Network policies, for those
S-NSSAIs for which Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization have been already initiated on another Access Type for the
same S-NSSAI(s). At the end of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization steps, the AMF by means of the UE Configuration Update
procedure shall provide a new Allowed NSSAI to the UE which also
contains the S-NSSAIs subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization for which the authentication and authorization is
successful. The AMF may perform AMF selection when NSSAA completes for
the S-NSSAIs subject to NSSAA. If an AMF change is required, this shall
be triggered by the AMF using the UE Configuration Update procedure
indicating a UE re-registration is required. The S-NSSAIs which were not
successfully authenticated and authorized are not included in the
Allowed NSSAI and are included in the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs with a
rejection cause value indicating Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization failure.

Once completed the Network Slice-Specific (re-)Authentication and
(re-)Authorization procedure, if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can
be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE, which is already
authenticated and authorized successfully by a PLMN, and if no default
S-NSSAI(s) could be added as described in step (A), the AMF shall
execute the Network-initiated Deregistration procedure described in
clause 4.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\] and shall include in the explicit
De-Registration Request message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of
them with the appropriate rejection cause value.

If an S-NSSAI is rejected with a rejection cause value indicating
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization failure or
revocation, the UE can re-attempt to request the S-NSSAI based on
policy, local in the UE.

##### 5.15.5.2.2 Modification of the Set of Network Slice(s) for a UE

The set of Network Slices for a UE can be changed at any time while the
UE is registered with a network, and may be initiated by the network, or
by the UE, under certain conditions as described below.

The network, based on local policies, subscription changes and/or UE
mobility and/or UE Dispersion data classification, operational reasons
(e.g. a Network Slice instance is no longer available or load level
information or service experience for a Network Slice or network slice
instance provided by the NWDAF), may change the set of Network Slice(s)
to which the UE is registered and provide the UE with a new Registration
Area and/or Allowed NSSAI and the mapping of this Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN
S-NSSAIs, for each Access Type over which the UE is registered. In
addition, the network may provide the Configured NSSAI for the Serving
PLMN, the associated mapping information, and the rejected S-NSSAIs. The
network may perform such a change over each Access Type during a
Registration procedure or trigger a notification towards the UE of the
change of the Network Slices using a UE Configuration Update procedure
as specified in clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The new Allowed
NSSAI(s) and the mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs are determined as described
in clause 5.15.5.2.1 (an AMF Re-allocation may be needed). The AMF
provides the UE with:

\- an indication that the acknowledgement from UE is required;

\- Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN (if required), rejected
S-NSSAI(s) (if required) and TAI list, and

\- the new Allowed NSSAI with the associated mapping of Allowed NSSAI
for each Access Type (as applicable) unless the AMF cannot determine the
new Allowed NSSAI (e.g. all S-NSSAIs in the old Allowed NSSAI have been
removed from the Subscribed S-NSSAIs).

Furthermore:

\- If the changes to the Allowed NSSAI require the UE to perform
immediately a Registration procedure because they affect the existing
connectivity to AMF (e.g. the new S-NSSAIs require a separate AMF that
cannot be determined by the current serving AMF, or the AMF cannot
determine the Allowed NSSAI) or due to AMF local policies also when the
changes does not affect the existing connectivity to AMF:

\- The serving AMF indicates to the UE the need for the UE to perform a
Registration procedure without including the GUAMI or 5G-S-TMSI in the
access stratum signalling after entering CM-IDLE state. The AMF shall
release the NAS signalling connection to the UE to allow to enter
CM-IDLE after receiving the acknowledgement from UE.

\- When the UE receives indications to perform a Registration procedure
without including the GUAMI or 5G-S-TMSI in the access stratum
signalling after entering CM-IDLE state, then:

\- The UE deletes any stored (old) Allowed NSSAI and associated mapping
as well as any (old) rejected S-NSSAI.

\- The UE shall initiate a Registration procedure with the registration
type Mobility Registration Update after the UE enters CM-IDLE state as
specified in as described in step 4 of clause 4.2.4.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. The UE shall include a Requested NSSAI (as described in
clause 5.15.5.2.1) with the associated mapping of Requested NSSAI in the
Registration Request message. Also, the UE shall include, subject to the
conditions set out in clause 5.15.9, a Requested NSSAI in access stratum
signalling but no GUAMI.

If there is an established PDU Session associated with emergency
services, then the serving AMF indicates to the UE the need for the UE
to perform a Registration procedure but does not release the NAS
signalling connection to the UE. The UE performs the Registration
procedure only after the release of the PDU Session used for the
emergency services.

In addition to sending the new Allowed NSSAI to the UE, when a Network
Slice used for a one or multiple PDU Sessions is no longer available for
a UE, the following applies:

\- If the Network Slice becomes no longer available under the same AMF
(e.g. due to UE subscription change), the AMF indicates to the SMF(s)
which PDU Session ID(s) corresponding to the relevant S-NSSAI shall be
released. SMF releases the PDU Session according to clause 4.3.4.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- If the Network Slice becomes no longer available upon a change of AMF
(e.g. due to Registration Area change), the new AMF indicates to the old
AMF that the PDU Session(s) corresponding to the relevant S-NSSAI shall
be released. The old AMF informs the corresponding SMF(s) to release the
indicated PDU Session(s). The SMF(s) release the PDU Session(s) as
described in clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. Then the new AMF modifies
the PDU Session Status correspondingly. The PDU Session(s) context is
locally released in the UE after receiving the PDU Session Status in the
Registration Accept message.

The UE uses either the URSP rules (which includes the NSSP) or the UE
Local Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 \[45\]
to determine whether ongoing traffic can be routed over existing PDU
Sessions belonging to other Network Slices or establish new PDU
Session(s) associated with same/other Network Slice.

In order to change the set of S-NSSAIs the UE is registered to over an
Access Type, the UE shall initiate a Registration procedure over this
Access Type as specified in clause 5.15.5.2.1.

If, for an established PDU Session:

\- none of the values of the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN in the mapping of the
Requested NSSAI to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN included in the Registration
Request matches the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN associated with the PDU
Session; or

\- none of the values of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI matches the
value of the S-NSSAI of HPLMN associated with the PDU Session and the
mapping of the Requested NSSAI to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN is not included
in the Registration Request,

the network shall release this PDU Session as follows.

\- the AMF informs the corresponding SMF(s) to release the indicated PDU
Session(s). The SMF(s) release the PDU Session(s) as described in
clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. Then the AMF modifies the PDU Session
Status correspondingly. The PDU Session(s) context is locally released
in the UE after receiving the PDU Session Status from the AMF.

A change of the set of S-NSSAIs (whether UE or Network initiated) to
which the UE is registered may, subject to operator policy, lead to AMF
change, as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1.

##### 5.15.5.2.3 AMF Re-allocation due to Network Slice(s) Support

During a Registration procedure in a PLMN, if the network decides that
the UE should be served by a different AMF based on Network Slice(s)
aspects, then the AMF that first received the Registration Request shall
redirect the Registration request to target AMF via the 5G-AN or via
direct signalling between the initial AMF and the target AMF. If the
target AMF(s) are returned from the NSSF and identified by a list of
candidate AMF(s), the redirection message shall only be sent via the
direct signalling between the initial AMF and the target AMF. If the
redirection message is sent by the AMF via the 5G-AN, the message shall
include information for selection of a new AMF to serve the UE.

When during a Registration procedure the UE requests a new S-NSSAI which
is not supported in the UE\'s current Tracking Area, the serving AMF
itself or by interacting with the NSSF as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1
may determine a Target NSSAI. The AMF provides the Target NSSAI to the
NG-RAN and the NG-RAN may apply redirection or handover of the UE to a
cell in another TA supporting the Target NSSAI as described in
clause 5.3.4.3.3.

During a EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface procedure, if the
network decides that the UE should be served by a different AMF based on
Network Slice(s) aspects, then the AMF, which received the Forward
Relocation Request from MME, shall forward the UE context to target AMF
via direct signalling between the initial AMF and the target AMF as
described in clause 4.11.1.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

For a UE that is already registered, the system shall support a
redirection initiated by the network of a UE from its serving AMF to a
target AMF due to Network Slice(s) considerations (e.g. the operator has
changed the mapping between the Network Slice instances and their
respective serving AMF(s)). Operator policy determines whether
redirection between AMFs is allowed.

#### 5.15.5.3 Establishing a PDU Session in a Network Slice

The PDU Session Establishment in a Network Slice instance to a DN allows
data transmission in a Network Slice instance. A PDU Session is
associated to an S-NSSAI and a DNN. A UE that is registered in a PLMN
over an Access Type and has obtained a corresponding Allowed NSSAI,
shall indicate in the PDU Session Establishment procedure the S-NSSAI
according to the NSSP in the URSP rules or according to the UE Local
Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 \[45\], and,
if available, the DNN the PDU Session is related to. The UE includes the
appropriate S-NSSAI from this Allowed NSSAI and, if mapping of the
Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs was provided, an S-NSSAI with the
corresponding value from this mapping.

If the UE cannot determine any S-NSSAI after performing the association
of the application to a PDU Session according to clause 6.1.2.2.1 of
TS 23.503 \[45\], the UE shall not indicate any S-NSSAI in the PDU
Session Establishment procedure.

The network (HPLMN) may provision the UE with Network Slice selection
policy (NSSP) as part of the URSP rules, see clause 6.6.2 of
TS 23.503 \[45\]. When the Subscription Information contains more than
one S-NSSAI and the network wants to control/modify the UE usage of
those S-NSSAIs, then the network provisions/updates the UE with NSSP as
part of the URSP rules. When the Subscription Information contains only
one S-NSSAI, the network needs not provision the UE with NSSP as part of
the URSP rules. The NSSP rules associate an application with one or more
HPLMN S-NSSAIs. A default rule which matches all applications to a HPLMN
S-NSSAI may also be included.

The UE shall store and use the URSP rules, including the NSSP, as
described in TS 23.503 \[45\]. When a UE application associated with a
specific S-NSSAI requests data transmission:

\- if the UE has one or more PDU Sessions established corresponding to
the specific S-NSSAI, the UE routes the user data of this application in
one of these PDU Sessions, unless other conditions in the UE prohibit
the use of these PDU Sessions. If the application provides a DNN, then
the UE considers also this DNN to determine which PDU Session to use.
This is further described in clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

\- If the UE does not have a PDU Session established with this specific
S-NSSAI, the UE requests a new PDU Session corresponding to this S-NSSAI
and with the DNN that may be provided by the application. In order for
the RAN to select a proper resource for supporting network slicing in
the RAN, RAN needs to be aware of the Network Slices used by the UE.
This is further described in clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

If the AMF is not able to determine the appropriate NRF to query for the
S-NSSAI provided by the UE, the AMF may query the NSSF with this
specific S-NSSAI, location information, PLMN ID of the SUPI. The NSSF
determines and returns the appropriate NRF to be used to select
NFs/services within the selected Network Slice instance. The NSSF may
also return an NSI ID to be used to select NFs within the selected
Network Slice instance to use for this S-NSSAI.

The AMF or NSSF may select a Network Slice instance based on load level
and/or Observe Service Experience and/or Dispersion analytics from
NWDAF.

The IP address or FQDN of the NSSF is locally configured in the AMF.

SMF discovery and selection within the selected Network Slice instance
is initiated by the AMF when a SM message to establish a PDU Session is
received from the UE. The appropriate NRF is used to assist the
discovery and selection tasks of the required network functions for the
selected Network Slice instance.

The AMF queries the appropriate NRF to select an SMF in a Network Slice
instance based on S-NSSAI, DNN, NSI-ID (if available) and other
information e.g. UE subscription and local operator policies, when the
UE triggers PDU Session Establishment. The selected SMF establishes a
PDU Session based on S-NSSAI and DNN.

When the AMF belongs to multiple Network Slice instances, based on
configuration, the AMF may use an NRF at the appropriate level for the
SMF selection.

For further details on the SMF selection, refer to clause 4.3.2.2.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

When a PDU Session for a given S-NSSAI is established using a specific
Network Slice instance, the CN provides to the (R)AN the S-NSSAI
corresponding to this Network Slice instance to enable the RAN to
perform access specific functions.

The UE shall not perform PDU Session handover from one Access Type to
another if the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is not included in the Allowed
NSSAI of the target Access Type.

### 5.15.6 Network Slicing Support for Roaming

For roaming scenarios:

\- If the UE only uses standard S-NSSAI values, then the same S-NSSAI
values can be used in VPLMN as in the HPLMN.

\- If the VPLMN and HPLMN have an SLA to support non-standard S-NSSAI
values in the VPLMN, the NSSF of the VPLMN maps the Subscribed S-NSSAIs
values to the respective S-NSSAI values to be used in the VPLMN. The
S-NSSAI values to be used in the VPLMN are determined by the NSSF of the
VPLMN based on the SLA. The NSSF of the VPLMN need not inform the HPLMN
of which values are used in the VPLMN.

Depending on operator\'s policy and the configuration in the AMF, the
AMF may decide the S-NSSAI values to be used in the VPLMN and the
mapping to the Subscribed S-NSSAIs.

\- The UE constructs Requested NSSAI and provides the mapping of
S-NSSAIs of the Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs if the mapping is
stored in the UE, as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1.

\- The NSSF in the VPLMN determines the Allowed NSSAI without
interacting with the HPLMN.

\- the HPLMN may provide NSSRG Information as part of the Subscription
information as described in clause 5.15.12.

\- The Allowed NSSAI in the Registration Accept includes S-NSSAI values
used in the VPLMN. The mapping information described above is also
provided to the UE with the Allowed NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.4.

\- If the S-NSSAI values are subject to NSAC, depending on operator\'s
policy, a roaming agreement or an SLA between VPLMN and HPLMN, the AMF
or SMF in VPLMN triggers a request for NSAC for these S-NSSAI values as
described in clause 5.15.11.3.

\- In PDU Session Establishment procedure, the UE includes both:

\(a\) the S-NSSAI that matches the application (that is triggering the
PDU Session Request) within the NSSP in the URSP rules or within the UE
Local Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 \[45\];
the value of this S NSSAI is used in the HPLMN; and

\(b\) an S-NSSAI belonging to the Allowed NSSAI that maps to (a) using
the mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs; the value of this
S-NSSAI is used in the VPLMN.

For the home routed case, the V-SMF sends the PDU Session Establishment
Request message to the H-SMF along with the S-NSSAI with the value used
in the HPLMN (a). If the S-NSSAI values are subject to NSAC, the V-SMF
or H-SMF triggers a request for NSAC for these S-NSSAI values as
described in clause 5.15.11.3.

\- When a PDU Session is established, the CN provides to the AN the
S-NSSAI with the value from the VPLMN corresponding to this PDU Session,
as described in clause 5.15.5.3.

\- The Network Slice instance specific network functions in the VPLMN
are selected by the VPLMN by using the S-NSSAI with the value used in
the VPLMN and querying an NRF that has either been pre-configured, or
provided by the NSSF in the VPLMN. The Network Slice specific functions
of the HPLMN (if applicable) are selected by the VPLMN by using the
related S-NSSAI with the value used in the HPLMN via the support from an
appropriate NRF in the HPLMN, identified as specified in clause 4.17.5
of TS 23.502 \[3\] and, for SMF in clause 4.3.2.2.3.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.15.7 Network slicing and Interworking with EPS

#### 5.15.7.1 General

A 5GS supports Network Slicing and might need to interwork with the EPS
in its PLMN or in other PLMNs as specified in clause 5.17.2. The EPC may
support the Dedicated Core Networks (DCN). In some deployments, the MME
selection may be assisted by a DCN-ID provided by the UE to the RAN (see
TS 23.401 \[26\]).

Mobility between 5GC to EPC does not guarantee all active PDU Session(s)
can be transferred to the EPC.

During PDN connection establishment in the EPC, the UE allocates the PDU
Session ID and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO. As described in
clause 4.11.0a.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\], an S-NSSAI associated with the PDN
connection is determined based on the S-NSSAI(s) supported by the
SMF+PGW-C, the Subscribed S-NSSAI from UDM and the operator policy by
the SMF+PGW-C, e.g. based on a combination of SMF+PGW-C address and APN,
and is sent to the UE in PCO together with a PLMN ID that the S-NSSAI
relates to. In Home Routed roaming case, the UE receives a HPLMN S-NSSAI
value from the SMF+PGW-C. If the SMF+PGW-C supports more than one
S-NSSAI and the APN is valid for more than one S-NSSAI, the SMF+PGW-C
should only select an S-NSSAI that is mapped to the subscribed S-NSSAI
of the UE and this subscribed S-NSSAI is not subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization. The UE stores this
S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID associated with the PDN connection. The UE
derives Requested NSSAI by taking into account of the received PLMN ID.
The Requested NSSAI is included in the NAS Registration Request message
and, subject to the conditions in clause 5.15.9, the RRC message
carrying this Registration Request when the UE registers in 5GC if the
UE is non-roaming or the UE has Configured NSSAI for the VPLMN in
roaming case. If the UE has no Configured NSSAI of the VPLMN, the UE
includes the HPLMN S-NSSAIs in the NAS Registration Request message as
described in clause 5.15.5.2.1.

When UE moves from EPS to 5GS, AMF reallocation may happen as described
in clause 5.15.7.2 and clause 5.15.7.3.

NOTE: It is assumed that if a MME is configured with a N26 interface
towards an AMF, the MME has N26 interfaces with all AMFs serving the
same area than the initial AMF and that can serve UE subject to EPS to
5GS mobility.

#### 5.15.7.2 Idle mode aspects

In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2
the following applies for interworking with N26:

\- When UE moves from 5GS to EPS, the UE context information sent by AMF
to MME includes the UE Usage type, which is retrieved from UDM by AMF as
part of subscription data.

\- When UE moves from EPS to 5GS, then the UE includes the S-NSSAIs
(with values for the Serving PLMN of the target 5GS, if available)
associated with the established PDN connections in the Requested NSSAI
in RRC Connection Establishment (subject to the conditions set out in
clause 5.15.9) and NAS. The UE also provides to the AMF in the
Registration Request message the mapping information as described in
clause 5.15.6. The UE derives the S-NSSAIs values for the Serving PLMN
by using the latest available information from EPS (if received in PCO)
and from 5GS (e.g. based on URSP, Configured NSSAI, Allowed NSSAI). In
the home-routed roaming case, the AMF selects default V-SMFs. The
SMF+PGW-C sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to AMF. The AMF
derives S-NSSAI values for the Serving PLMN as described in
clause 5.15.5.2.1 and determines whether the AMF is the appropriate AMF
to serve the UE. If not, the AMF reallocation may need be triggered. For
each PDU Session the AMF determines whether the V-SMF need be reselected
based on the associated S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN. If the V-SMF
need be reallocated, i.e. change from the default V-SMF to another
V-SMF, the AMF trigger the V-SMF reallocation as described in
clause 4.23.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2
the following applies for interworking without N26:

\- When the UE initiates the Registration procedure, and subject to the
conditions set out in clause 5.15.9, the UE includes the S-NSSAI (with
values for the Serving PLMN of the target 5GS) associated with the
established PDN connections in the Requested NSSAI in the RRC Connection
Establishment.

\- The UE includes the S-NSSAIs (with values for the Serving PLMN of the
target 5GS, if available) and the HPLMN S-NSSAI received in the PCO for
the PDN connections as mapping information when moving PDN connections
to 5GC using PDU Session Establishment Request message. The UE derives
the S-NSSAIs values for the Serving PLMN by using, the latest available
information from EPS (if received in PCO) and from 5GS (e.g. based on
URSP, Configured NSSAI, Allowed NSSAI).

#### 5.15.7.3 Connected mode aspects

In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2
the following applies for interworking with N26:

\- When a UE is CM-CONNECTED in 5GC and a handover to EPS occur, the AMF
selects the target MME based on the source AMF Region ID, AMF Set ID and
target location information. The AMF forwards the UE context to the
selected MME over the N26 Interface. In the UE context, the AMF also
includes the UE Usage type, if it is received as part of subscription
data. The Handover procedure is executed as documented in
TS 23.502 \[3\]. When the Handover procedure completes successfully the
UE performs a Tracking Area Update. This completes the UE registration
in the target EPS. As part of this the UE obtains a DCN-ID if the target
EPS uses it.

\- When a UE is ECM-CONNECTED in EPC, and performs a handover to 5GS,
the MME selects the target AMF based on target location information,
e.g. TAI and any other available local information (including the UE
Usage Type if one is available for the UE in the subscription data) and
forwards the UE context to the selected AMF over the N26 interface. In
the home-routed roaming case, the AMF selects default V-SMFs. The
Handover procedure is executed as documented in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The
SMF+PGW-C sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to AMF. Based on
the received S-NSSAIs values the target AMF derives the S-NSSAI values
for the Serving PLMN, the target AMF reselects a final target AMF if
necessary as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1, the AMF reallocation
procedure is triggered. For each PDU Session based on the associated
derived S-NSSAI values if the V-SMF need be reallocated, the final
target AMF triggers the V-SMF reallocation as described in clause 4.23.2
of TS 23.502 \[3\]. When the Handover procedure completes successfully
the UE performs a Registration procedure. This completes the UE
registration in the target 5GS and as part of this the UE obtains an
Allowed NSSAI.

### 5.15.8 Configuration of Network Slice availability in a PLMN

A Network Slice may be available in the whole PLMN or in one or more
Tracking Areas of the PLMN.

The availability of a Network Slice refers to the support of the S-NSSAI
in the involved NFs. In addition, policies in the NSSF may further
restrict from using certain Network Slices in a particular TA, e.g.
depending on the HPLMN of the UE.

The availability of a Network Slice in a TA is established end-to-end
using a combination of OAM and signalling among network functions. It is
derived by using the S-NSSAIs supported per TA in 5G-AN, the S-NSSAIs
supported in the AMF and operator policies per TA in the NSSF.

The AMF learns the S-NSSAIs supported per TA by the 5G-AN when the 5G-AN
nodes establish or update the N2 connection with the AMF (see
TS 38.413 \[34\]) and TS 38.300 \[27\]). One or all AMF per AMF Set
provides and updates the NSSF with the S-NSSAIs support per TA. The
5G-AN learns the S-NSSAIs per PLMN ID the AMFs it connects to support
when the 5G-AN nodes establishes the N2 connection with the AMF or when
the AMF updates the N2 connection with the 5G-AN (see TS 38.413 \[34\]
and TS 38.300 \[27\]).

The NSSF may be configured with operator policies specifying under what
conditions the S-NSSAIs can be restricted per TA and per HPLMN of the
UE.

The per TA restricted S-NSSAIs may be provided to the AMFs of the AMF
Sets at setup of the network and whenever changed.

The AMF may be configured for the S-NSSAIs it supports with operator
policies specifying any restriction per TA and per HPLMN of the UE.

### 5.15.9 Operator-controlled inclusion of NSSAI in Access Stratum Connection Establishment

The Serving PLMN can control per Access Type which (if any) NSSAI the UE
includes in the Access Stratum when establishing a connection caused by
Service Request, Periodic Registration Update or Registration procedure
used to update the UE capabilities. In addition, the Home and Visited
PLMNs can also instruct the UE to never include NSSAI in the Access
Stratum, regardless of the procedure that causes a RRC Connection to be
established, i.e. to always enable privacy for the NSSAI).

During the Registration procedure, the AMF may provide to the UE in the
Registration Accept message, an Access Stratum Connection Establishment
NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, indicating whether and when the UE shall
include NSSAI information in the Access Stratum Connection Establishment
(e.g. an RRC connection Establishment defined in TS 38.331 \[28\])
according to one of these modes:

a\) The UE shall include an NSSAI set to the Allowed NSSAI, if
available, in the Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by a
Service Request, Periodic Registration Update or Registration procedure
used to update the UE capabilities;

b\) The UE shall include a NSSAI with the following content:

\- for the case of Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by a
Service Request: an NSSAI including the S-NSSAI(s) of the Network
Slice(s) that trigger the Access Stratum Connection Establishment; i.e.
all the S-NSSAIs of the PDU sessions that have the User Plane
reactivated by the Service Request, or the S-NSSAIs of the Network
Slices a Control Plane interaction triggering the Service Request is
related to, e.g. for SM it would be the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session the
SM message is about;

\- for the case of Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by a
Periodic Registration Update or Registration procedure used to update
the UE capabilities, an NSSAI set to the Allowed NSSAI;

c\) The UE shall not include any NSSAI in the Access Stratum Connection
Establishment caused by Service Request, Periodic Registration Update or
Registration procedure used to update the UE capabilities; or

d\) The UE shall not provide NSSAI in the Access stratum.

For the case of Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by
Mobility Registration Update or Initial Registration in modes a), b) or
c) the UE shall include the Requested NSSAI provided by the NAS layer
and defined in clause 5.15.5.2.1.

For all UEs that are allowed to use modes a), b) or c), the Access
Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode should be the same
over the same Registration Areas.The UE shall store and comply to the
required behaviour for a PLMN per Access Type as part of the network
slicing configuration. The Serving PLMN AMF shall not instruct the UE to
operate in any other mode than mode d) in 3GPP Access Type unless the
HPLMN provides an indication that it is allowed to do so (i.e. if a PLMN
allows behaviours a,b,c, then its UDM sends to the serving AMF an
explicit indication that the NSSAI can be included in RRC as part of the
subscription data).

The UE default mode of operation is the following:

\- For 3GPP access the UE shall by default operate in mode d) unless it
has been provided with an indication to operate in mode a), b) or c).

\- For untrusted non-3GPP access the UE shall operate by default in mode
b) unless it has been provided with an indication to operate in mode a),
c) or d).

\- For trusted non-3GPP access the UE shall operate by default in mode
d) unless it has been provided with an indication to operate in mode a),
b) or c).

\- For W-5GAN access the 5G-RG shall operate by default in mode b)
unless it has been provided with an indication to operate in mode a), c)
or d).

An operator may pre-configure the UE to operate by default according to
mode c) in the HPLMN (i.e. the UE by default includes NSSAI in the
access stratum when it performs an Initial Registration and Mobility
Registration Update with the HPLMN until the HPLMN changes the mode as
described above).

### 5.15.10 Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization

A serving PLMN or SNPN shall perform Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization for the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN or SNPN
which are subject to it based on subscription information. The UE shall
indicate in the Registration Request message in the UE 5GMM Core Network
Capability whether it supports NSSAA feature. If the UE does not support
NSSAA feature and if the UE requests any of these S-NSSAIs that are
subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the
AMF shall not trigger this procedure for the UE and they are rejected
for the PLMN or SNPN. If the UE supports NSSAA feature and if the UE
requests any of these S-NSSAIs that are subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, they are included in
the list of Pending NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN, as described in
clause 5.15.5.2.1.

If a UE is configured with S-NSSAIs, which are subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the UE stores an
association between the S-NSSAI and corresponding credentials for the
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization.

NOTE 1: How the UE is aware that an S-NSSAI is subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (e.g., based on local
configuration) is out of scope of this specification.

The UE may support remote provisioning of credentials for NSSAA,
specified in clause 5.39.

A UE that supports to be provisioned with the credentials used for NSSAA
over UP remote provisioning shall use connectivity over an S-NSSAI/DNN
which can access the provisioning server to establish a PDU session for
remote provisioning as defined in clause 5.39.

NOTE 2: The credentials for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization are not specified.

To perform the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
for an S-NSSAI, the AMF invokes an EAP- based Network Slice-Specific
authorization procedure documented in clause 4.2.9 of TS 23.502 \[3\]
(see also TS 33.501 \[29\]) for the S-NSSAI. When an NSSAA procedure is
started and is ongoing for an S-NSSAI, the AMF stores the NSSAA status
of the S-NSSAI as pending and when the NSSAA is completed the S-NSSAI
becomes either part of the Allowed NSSAI or a Rejected S-NSSAI. The
NSSAA status of each S-NSSAI, if any is stored, is transferred when the
AMF changes.

This procedure can be invoked for a supporting UE by an AMF at any time,
e.g. when:

a\. The UE registers with the AMF and one of the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN
or SNPN which maps to an S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI is requiring
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (see
clause 5.15.5.2.1 for details), and the S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI
can be added to the Allowed NSSAI by the AMF once the Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for the HPLMN or SNPN
S-NSSAI succeeds; or

b\. The Network Slice-Specific AAA Server triggers a UE
re-authentication and re-authorization for an S-NSSAI; or

c\. The AMF, based on operator policy or a subscription change, decides
to initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
procedure for a certain S-NSSAI which was previously authorized.

In the case of re-authentication and re-authorization (b. and c. above)
the following applies:

\- If S-NSSAIs that are requiring Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization map to S-NSSAIs that are included in the Allowed NSSAI
for each Access Type, AMF selects an Access Type to be used to perform
the Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure
based on network policies.

\- If the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for
some S-NSSAIs mapped to some S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI is
unsuccessful, the AMF shall update the Allowed NSSAI for each Access
Type to the UE via UE Configuration Update procedure.

\- If the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization fails
for all S-NSSAIs mapped to all S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI, the AMF
determines a new Allowed NSSAI including default S-NSSAI(s). If no
default S-NSSAI(s) could be added, the AMF shall execute the
Network-initiated Deregistration procedure described in clause 4.2.2.3.3
of TS 23.502 \[3\] and shall include in the explicit De-Registration
Request message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the
appropriate rejection cause value.

After a successful or unsuccessful UE Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization, the UE context in the AMF shall retain
the authentication and authorization status for the UE for the related
specific S-NSSAI of the HPLMN or SNPN while the UE remains RM-REGISTERED
in the PLMN or SNPN, so that the AMF is not required to execute a
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for a UE at
every Periodic Registration Update or Mobility Registration procedure
with the PLMN or SNPN.

A Network Slice-Specific AAA server may revoke the authorization or
challenge the authentication and authorization of a UE at any time. When
authorization is revoked for an S-NSSAI that maps to an S-NSSAI in the
current Allowed NSSAI for an Access Type, the AMF shall provide a new
Allowed NSSAI to the UE and trigger the release of all PDU sessions
associated with the S-NSSAI, for this Access Type.

The AMF provides the GPSI of the UE related to the S-NSSAI to the AAA
Server to allow the AAA server to initiate the Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization, or the Authorization revocation
procedure, where the current AMF serving the UE needs to be identified
by the system, so the UE authorization status can be challenged or
revoked.

The Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization requires
that the UE Primary Authentication and Authorization of the SUPI has
successfully completed. If the SUPI authorization is revoked, then also
the Network Slice-Specific authorization is revoked.

### 5.15.11 Network Slice Admission Control

#### 5.15.11.0 General

The Network Slice Admission Control Function (NSACF) monitors and
controls the number of registered UEs per network slice and/or the
number of PDU Sessions per network slice for the network slices that are
subject to Network Slice Admission Control (NSAC). The NSACF is
configured with the maximum number of UEs and/or the maximum number of
PDU Sessions allowed to be served per S-NSSAI subject to NSAC. The NSACF
is also configured with information indicating applicable access type(s)
for the S-NSSAI (i.e. 3GPP Access Type, Non-3GPP Access Type, or both).

The NSACF also provides event-based Network Slice status notifications
and reports to the consumer NFs (e.g. AF).

The NSACF may be responsible for one or more S-NSSAIs. There may be one
or multiple NSACFs deployed in a network as follows:

\- If the network is configured with a single service area, there is a
single NSACF configured with the maximum number of UEs per network slice
and/or the maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice, which are
valid in the network.

\- If the network is configured with multiple service areas, an NSACF
may be deployed on a service area basis, which can be one NSACF instance
or one NSACF Set. Each NSACF is configured with the maximum number of
UEs per network slice and/or the maximum number of PDU Sessions which
are valid in the service area.

If multiple NSACFs are configured in a PLMN or an SNPN for a network
slice, a NSACF is configured with a maximum number of UEs and/or a
maximum number of PDU Sessions specific for the service area and the
Network Slice.

NOTE 1: When multiple NSACFs are deployed, how the maximum number of UEs
per network slice and the maximum number of PDU Sessions per network
slice is distributed among multiple NSACFs, is implementation specific.

NOTE 2: When multiple NSACFs are deployed, the UE moves to new service
area with a different NSACF, and if the number of UE or PDU Sessions in
the target NSACF has reached the maximum number, whether the session
continuity can be guaranteed is left to implementation.

Subject to operator policy and national/regional regulations, the AMF
may exempt UEs and the SMF may exempt PDU sessions from NSAC when the UE
and/or PDU Session is used for Emergency service or for Critical and
Priority services (e.g. MCX, MPS).

When the AMF receives a Registration Request for an Emergency
Registration, or with a Registration Request with an Establishment Cause
indicating a priority service (e.g. MCX, MPS) or when the AMF determines
that there is a priority subscription (e.g., MPS, MCX) in the UDM, the
AMF may accept the registration request without applying NSAC, i.e. the
AMF triggers the NSAC procedure, but the response from the NSACF is
ignored at the AMF.

When the SMF receives a PDU Session Establishment Request for an
emergency PDU Session or a PDU Session Establishment Request with a
priority header, the SMF may accept the PDU Session Establishment
Request without applying NSAC, i.e. the SMF triggers the NSAC procedure,
but the response from the NSACF is ignored at the SMF.

Alternatively, when NSAC is exempted for the UE and/or PDU Session, the
AMF and the SMF skip the corresponding NSAC procedure, i.e. this UE
(respectively PDU Session) is not counted towards the maximum number of
UEs (respectively PDU Sessions).

The support of NSAC for the S-NSSAI used for onboarding as described in
clause 5.30.2.10 is optional and subject to Onboarding Network operator
policies. However, NSAC for S-NSSAI used for onboarding is not
applicable to UEs that registered in ON-SNPN with Registration Type
\"SNPN Onboarding\".

#### 5.15.11.1 Network Slice Admission Control for maximum number of UEs

The NSACF keeps track of the current number of UEs registered for a
network slice so that it can ensure it does not exceed the maximum
number of UEs allowed to register with the network slice. The NSACF also
maintains a list of UE IDs registered with a network slice that is
subject to NSAC. When an event related to a UE causes the current number
of UEs registered with a network slice to increase, the NSACF first
checks whether the UE Identity is already in the list of UEs registered
with that network slice. If not, the NSACF checks whether the maximum
number of UEs per network slice for that network slice has already been
reached and if it has, the NSACF applies admission control policies.

The AMF triggers a request to NSACF for NSAC for maximum number of UEs
when the UE\'s registration status for a network slice subject to NSAC
is changing, i.e. during the UE Registration procedure in
clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\], UE Deregistration procedure in
clause 4.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorisation procedure in clause 4.2.9.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\], AAA
Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and
Re-authorization procedure in clause 4.2.9.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], AAA
Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation in
clause 4.2.9.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\] and UE Configuration Update procedure
in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 1: Early Admission Control (EAC) mode is applicable for Number of
UEs per network slice admission control. The use of EAC in relation to
the number of registered UEs is described in clauses 4.2.11.2 and
4.2.11.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Since the UE may register or deregister for an S-NSSAI via 3GPP access
and/or non-3GPP access as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1. The Allowed
NSSAI for the access type may change while the UE is registering to a
network. The AMF provides the Access Type to the NSACF when triggering a
request to increase or decrease the current number of UEs registered
with a S-NSSAI. The NSACF may take the Access Type into account for
increasing and decreasing the number of UEs per network slice by storing
the UE ID with the associated one or more Access Type(s), i.e. the NSACF
is able to add or remove a registration for the UE ID for each Access
Type and trigger the increase or decrease of the current number of UEs
registered with a S-NSSAI based on a policy that takes the access type
into account. If the Access Type provided by the AMF is not configured
for NSAC in the NSACF, the NSACF always accepts the request from the AMF
without increasing or decreasing the number of UEs. If the Access Type
provided by the AMF is configured for NSAC in the NSACF and the maximum
number is reached, the NSACF sends a reject response to the AMF
including the access type.

NOTE 2: For example, if the NSACF is configured to apply NSAC for 3GPP
Access Type only, the NSACF counts registration via 3GPP access type
only. If the NSACF is configured to apply NSAC for both Access Types,
and the UE newly registers via 3GPP access while the UE is already
registered via non-3GPP access (or vice versa), the NSACF updates the UE
ID entry with both 3GPP Access Type and non-3GPP Access Type and the
NSACF may count the UE once or twice based on its policy.

#### 5.15.11.2 Network Slice Admission Control for maximum number of PDU sessions

The NSACF keeps track of the current number of PDU Sessions per network
slice so that it can ensure it does not exceed the maximum number of PDU
session allowed to be served by the network slice. When an event related
to a UE causes the current number of PDU sessions established within the
network slice is to increase, the NSACF checks whether the maximum
number of PDU sessions per network slice for that network slice has
already been reached and if it has, the NSACF applies admission control
policies.

The anchor SMF triggers a request to NSACF for maximum number of PDU
sessions per network slice control during PDU session
establishment/release procedures in clauses 4.3.2 and 4.3.4 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The SMF provides the Access Type to the NSACF when triggering a request
to increase or decrease the number of PDU Sessions. The NSACF takes
Access Type into account for increasing and decreasing the current
number of PDU Sessions depending on the applicability of the Access Type
for the NSAC for maximum number of PDU Sessions for the S-NSSAI.

NOTE 1: For MA PDU Session, the SMF provides the Access Type to NSACF
when the user plane connection is about to be established or released in
the corresponding access network. With this, the SMF provides one or two
Access Types for the MA PDU Session in the same request message to the
NSACF. The NSACF can reject a single or both Access Types depending on
the applicability of the Access Type for the NSAC.

NOTE 2: I-SMF does not interact with NSCAF.

#### 5.15.11.3 Network Slice Admission Control for Roaming

In the case of roaming, depending on operator\'s policy, a roaming
agreement or an SLA between the VPLMN and the HPLMN, NSAC of roaming UEs
is performed by the VPLMN or HPLMN. The following principles apply:

For NSAC of roaming UEs for maximum number of UEs per network slice
and/or maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice managed by the
VPLMN, the following principles shall be used:

\- Each S-NSSAI of the HPLMN that is subject to NSAC is mapped to a
corresponding S-NSSAI of the VPLMN subject to NSAC, depending on VPLMN
operator\'s policy and the configuration.

\- For NSAC for the maximum number of UEs for S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, a
NSACF in the VPLMN can be configured with the maximum number of allowed
roaming UEs per mapped S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for a S-NSSAI of the HPLMN
that is subject to NSAC. In such a case, the AMFs trigger a request to a
NSACF of the VPLMN.

\- For NSAC for the maximum number of PDU Sessions for S-NSSAI of the
HPLMN, a NSACF in the VPLMN can be configured with the maximum number of
allowed PDU Sessions in LBO mode per mapped S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for a
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN that is subject to NSAC. In such a case, the anchor
SMF in the VPLMN triggers a request to a NSACF of the VPLMN.

\- For NSAC for the maximum number of UEs for S-NSSAI of the VPLMN, AMFs
trigger a request to a NSACF of the VPLMN to perform NSAC based on the
S-NSSAI of the VPLMN subject to NSAC. The NSACF of the HPLMN is not
involved.

\- For NSAC for the maximum number of PDU Sessions for S-NSSAI of the
VPLMN in the LBO roaming case, the SMF triggers a request to a NSACF of
the VPLMN to perform NSAC based on the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN subject to
NSAC. The NSACF of the HPLMN is not involved.

‐ The AMF or SMF (in LBO roaming case) in the VPLMN provides both the
S-NSSAI in the VPLMN and the corresponding mapped S-NSSAI in the HPLMN
to the NSACF in the VPLMN. The NSACF in the VPLMN performs NSAC for both
S-NSSAI of the VPLMN and the corresponding mapped S-NSSAI of the HPLMN
based on the SLA between the VPLMN and the HPLMN.

For NSAC for roaming UEs for maximum number of PDU Sessions per network
slice managed by the HPLMN, the following principles shall be used:

\- For PDU sessions in the home-routed roaming case, the SMF in the
HPLMN performs NSAC for the S-NSSAI(s) subject to NSAC.

NOTE: The NSAC for maximum number PDU session in LBO mode and maximum
number of roaming UEs when the NSAC is managed by a NSACF in the HPLMN
is not supported in this Release of the specification.

#### 5.15.11.4 Network Slice status notifications and reports to a consumer NF

A consumer NF (e.g. AF) can subscribe with the NSACF for Network Slice
status notifications and reports. Upon such subscription, the NSACF can
provide event based notifications and reports to the consumer NF (e.g.
to AF via NEF) related to the current number of UEs registered for a
network slice or the current number of PDU Sessions established on a
network slice.

#### 5.15.11.5 Support of Network Slice Admission Control and Interworking with EPC

If EPS counting is required for a network slice, the NSAC for maximum
number of UEs and/or for maximum number of PDU Sessions per network
slice is performed at the time of PDN connection establishment in case
of EPC interworking. To support the NSAC for maximum number of UEs
and/or for maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice in EPC, the
SMF+PGW-C is configured with the information indicating which network
slice is subject to NSAC. During PDN connection establishment in EPC,
the SMF+PGW-C selects an S-NSSAI associated with the PDN connection as
described in clause 5.15.7.1. If the selected S-NSSAI by the SMF+PGW-C
is subject to the NSAC, the SMF+PGW-C triggers interaction with NSACF to
check the availability of the network slice by invoking separate NSAC
procedures for number of UE and number of PDU Session (as described in
clause 4.11.5.9 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), before the SMF+PGW-C provides the
selected S-NSSAI to the UE. If the network slice is available, the
SMF+PGW-C continues to proceed with the PDN connection establishment
procedure.

The NSACF performs the following for checking network slice availability
prior to returning a response to the SMF+PGW-C:

\- For NSAC for number of UEs, if the UE identity is already included in
the list of UE IDs registered with a network slice, or the UE identity
is not included in the list of UE IDs registered with a network slice
and the current number of UE registration did not reach the maximum
number, the NSACF responds to the SMF+PGW-C with the information that
the network slice is available. The NSACF includes the UE identity in
the list of UE IDs if not already on the list and increases the current
number of UE registration. Otherwise, the NSACF returns a response
indicating that the maximum number with the network slice has been
reached.

\- For NSAC for number of PDU Sessions, if the current number of PDU
sessions is below the maximum number, the NSACF responds to the
SMF+PGW-C with the information that the network slice is available. The
NSACF increases the current number of PDU sessions. Otherwise, the NSACF
returns the response indicating that the maximum number with the network
slice has been reached.

If the maximum number of UEs and/or the maximum number of PDU sessions
has already been reached, unless operator policy implements a different
action, the SMF+PGW-C rejects the PDN connection.

NOTE 1: As an implementation option, if the APN is mapped to more than
one S-NSSAI and the first selected S-NSSAI is not available (e.g. either
current number of UE registration reached maximum or current number of
PDU sessions reached maximum), then based on the operator policy the
PGW-C+SMF can try another mapped S-NSSAI for the PDN connection
establishment procedure.

If the establishment of a new PDN Connections is with a different
SMF+PGW-C from the SMF+PGW-C used for already existing PDN connection
associated with the same S-NSSAI, each SMF+PGW-C will send a request for
update (e.g. increase or decrease) to the NSACF. The NSACF may maintain
a registration entry per SMF+PGW-C for the same UE ID.

The SMF+PGW-C provides the Access Type to the NSACF when triggering a
request to increase or decrease the number of UEs and/or the number of
PDU Sessions for an S-NSSAI.

NOTE 2: The SMF+PGW-C determines the Access Type based on the RAT type
parameter in the PMIP or GTP message received from the ePDG; or
alternatively it can internally determine the Access Type based on the
source node (e.g. SGW) sending the request for the PDN Connection
establishment.

When the UE with ongoing PDN connection(s) moves from EPC to 5GC, the
SMF+PGW-C triggers a request to decrease the number of the UE
registration in NSACF and the AMF triggers a request to increase the
number of the UE registration in NSACF when the UE is registered in the
new AMF. If there are more than one PDN connections associated with the
S-NSSAI, the NSACF may receive multiple requests for the same S-NSSAI
from different SMF+PGW-Cs. When the UE with ongoing PDU session(s) moves
from 5GC to EPC, the SMF+PGW-C triggers a request to increase the number
of the UE registration in NSACF and the old AMF triggers a request to
decrease the number of the UE registration in NSACF when the UE is
deregistered in old AMF. If there are more than one PDU sessions
associated with the S-NSSAI, the NSACF may receive multiple requests for
the same S-NSSAI from different SMF+PGW-Cs. The NSACF maintains a list
of UE IDs based on the requests from SMF+PGW-C(s) and AMF, and adjusts
the current number of registrations accordingly.

When EPS counting is performed for a network slice, and the UE with
ongoing PDN connection(s) moves from EPC to 5GC, session continuity is
guaranteed from NSAC standpoint, as the admission was granted at the
time of PDN connection establishment, i.e. the number of PDU session is
not counted again in 5GC. Similarly, when the UE with ongoing PDU
session(s) moves from 5GC to EPC, session continuity is guaranteed from
NSAC standpoint as the admission of the PDN Connection(s) to the network
slice was already granted at the time of PDU Session establishment in
5GC.

If the PDN connection associated with S-NSSAI is released in EPC, the
SMF+PGW-C triggers a request (i.e. decrease) to NSACF for maximum number
of UEs and/or maximum number of PDU sessions per network slice control.
The NSACF decreases the current number of registrations and removes the
UE identity from the list of UE IDs if the PDN connection(s) associated
with the S-NSSAI are all released in EPC.

NOTE 3: NSAC in EPC is not performed for the attachment without PDN
connectivity.

If EPS counting is not required for a network slice, the NSAC for
maximum number of UEs and/or for maximum number of PDU Sessions per
network slice is performed when the UE moves from EPC to 5GC, i.e. when
the UE performs mobility Registration procedure from EPC to 5GC (NSAC
for maximum number of UEs per network slice) and/or when the PDN
connections are handed over from EPC to 5GC (NSAC for maximum number of
PDU Sessions per network slice). The SMF+PGW-C is configured with the
information indicating the network slice is subject to NSAC only in 5GS.
The PDN connection interworking procedure is performed as described in
clause 5.15.7.1. Mobility from EPC to 5GC does not guarantee all active
PDU Session(s) can be transferred to the 5GC in certain circumstances
when either the current number of UE registration or the current number
of PDU sessions would exceed the maximum number when the UE moves from
EPC to 5GC.

NOTE 4: Given that session continuity is not guaranteed when EPS
counting is not required, it is recommended for services which require
the session continuity to support EPS counting.

NOTE 5: When multiple NSACFs are deployed and if the number of UE in
target NSACF has reached the maximum number, whether session continuity
can be guaranteed is left to implementation.

### 5.15.12 Support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices

#### 5.15.12.1 General

The subscription information for a UE may include for each S-NSSAI
Network Slice Simultaneous Registration Group (NSSRG) information
constraining which S-NSSAIs can be simultaneously provided to the UE in
the Allowed NSSAI.

When S-NSSAIs have associated NSSRG information, then the S-NSSAIs in
the Allowed NSSAI shall share at least one NSSRG.

The NSSRG information, defining the association of S-NSSAIs to NSSRG, is
provided as an additional and separate information.

If the optional NSSRG information is not present for the S-NSSAIs of a
subscription, and other restrictions do not apply e.g. availability at a
specific location, then it is assumed that all the S-NSSAIs in the
subscription information can be simultaneously provided to the UE in the
Allowed NSSAI. However, if NSSRG information is present in the
subscription information, at least one NSSRG shall be associated with
each of the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information. At any time, if
the AMF has received subscription information for a UE that includes
NSSRG information, the Allowed NSSAI for the UE can only include
S-NSSAIs which share a common NSSRG.

The default S-NSSAIs, if more than one is present, are associated with
the same NSSRGs, i.e. the UE is always allowed to be registered with all
the default S-NSSAIs simultaneously. The HPLMN only sends S-NSSAIs
sharing all the NSSRGs of the Default S-NSSAIs to a non-supporting VPLMN
as part of the subscription information, i.e. in addition to the default
S-NSSAI(s), the HPLMN may send any other subscribed S-NSSAI which shares
at least all the NSSRG defined for the default S-NSSAI(s), and the HPLMN
sends no NSSRG information to the VPLMN. A subscription information that
includes NSSRG information shall include at least one default S-NSSAI.

A supporting AMF/NSSF, when it receives a Requested NSSAI, evaluates the
S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN (in the mapping information of the Requested
NSSAI, when a mapping information is applicable) based on any received
NSSRG information for these S-NSSAIs, to determines whether they can be
provided together in the Allowed NSSAI.

NOTE : An HPLMN enabling support of subscription-based restrictions to
simultaneous registration of network slices for a Subscriber, can set
the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) already in the subscription information before
the NSSRG information was added to the subscription information, to have
the same NSSRGs defined for the default S-NSSAI(s) if it has to continue
to support the same service behaviour for these S-NSSAIs.

#### 5.15.12.2 UE and UE configuration aspects

A UE may support the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slices feature. In this case, the UE indicates
its support in the Registration Request message in the Initial
Registration and the Mobility Registration Update as part of the UE 5GMM
Core Network Capability.

When the serving AMF provides the Configured NSSAI to the UE, and the UE
has indicated it supports the subscription-based restrictions to
simultaneous registration of network slices feature, the AMF also
provides the UE with the NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of
the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of the Configured NSSAI.
A UE which receives the NSSRG values in the network slicing
configuration information shall only include in the Requested NSSAI
S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received information. If
the HPLMN changes NSSRG information in the subscription information for
a UE, the UDM updates the supporting AMF serving the UE with the new
NSSRG information and the AMF, possibly after interaction with the NSSF
(see clause 5.2.16.2.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), updates the UE as necessary
with network slicing configuration by means of the UE Configuration
Update procedure (this may include changes in the Configured NSSAI (and
related mapping information) and changes in the Allowed NSSAI as
applicable). The UE acknowledges this UE Configuration Update according
to clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

At any time, a UE supporting subscription-based restrictions to
simultaneous registration of network slices feature and that has
received NSSRG information together with the Configured NSSAI shall only
request S-NSSAIs, across all Access Type(s), that share one or more
common NSSRG.

NOTE: In Requested NSSAI across all Access Type(s), the UE needs to
include S-NSSAIs that share at least one common NSSRG.

An AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to
simultaneous registration of network slice feature configures a
non-supporting UE with a Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs
sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), except if it has
been instructed otherwise by the UDM. In addition to the default
S-NSSAI(s), the AMF sends to the UE in the Configured NSSAI any other
subscribed S-NSSAI whose NSSRG match at least those defined for the
default S-NSSAI(s).

The UDM in a supporting HPLMN may optionally keep a record of the PEIs
or Type Allocation Codes values regarding UE ability to handle network
slices that cannot be provided simultaneously in Allowed NSSAI.

The UDM may, based on configuration or the optional PEI records,
indicate the AMF to provide the non-supporting UEs with the full set of
subscribed S-NSSAIs even if they do not share a common NSSRG. The UDM
instructs the supporting AMFs of a PLMN to do so by indicating that the
UE can be given a Configured NSSAI with all the S-NSSAIs in the
subscription information. If this indication is received from the UDM by
the AMF, this is included in the UE context.

Based on its policy (including configuration or optionally checking the
specific PEI or Type Allocation Code used by the UE, and subject to
roaming agreement) the UDM may also provide the serving AMF in a
non-supporting VPLMN with all the S-NSSAI in the subscription
information. In this case the AMF provides the UE with a Configured
NSSAI including all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information the AMF
receives.

The AMF provides no NSSRG information to a non-supporting UE.

When an AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to
simultaneous registration of network slice feature, receives from a UE a
Requested NSSAI including S-NSSAIs that are supported in the Tracking
Area but do not share a common NSSRG, the AMF assumes the UE
configuration is not up-to-date, and provides the following:

\- a supporting UE with an updated configuration including the
up-to-date NSSRG information for the S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI as
described above.

\- a non-supporting UE with an updated Configured NSSAI including only
the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s),
only for the case where the UE context does not include an indication to
provide all the subscribed S-NSSAIs in the subscription information in
the Configured NSSAI for the UE.

### 5.15.13 Support of data rate limitation per Network Slice for a UE

A UE subscription information may include an optional Slice Maximum Bit
Rate for the UE (Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR) for an S-NSSAI, which applies
for 3GPP access type only. The Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR includes a UL and
a DL value. If a Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR is associated to an S-NSSAI in
the subscription information, it is provided by the AMF to the RAN when
the AMF provides the Allowed NSSAI for the UE to the RAN as UE-Slice-MBR
QoS parameter. The UE-Slice-MBR QoS parameter is defined in
clause 5.7.2.6. If the Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR for a UE changes, the AMF
updates UE-Slice-MBR in the RAN accordingly.

In roaming case, the UE-Slice-MBR is provided for the S-NSSAI of the
VPLMN which maps to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN and the AMF may first
interact with the PCF for authorization of the Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR.
If the AMF interacts with the PCF, the PCF may provide the Authorized
UE-Slice-MBR that is used as UE-Slice-MBR by the AMF as described in
clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

For a roaming UE, the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN maps to only one S-NSSAI of
the HPLMN for which an UE-Slice-MBR is applied.

The enforcement of the UE-Slice-MBR value, if present in the UE context
in the RAN for an S-NSSAI, is described in clause 5.7.1.10.

NOTE: The PCF for the PDU Session may in addition be configured to
monitor the data rate per Network Slice for a UE and to strengthen or
relax the traffic restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or PCC rules
accordingly, as described in TS 23.503 \[45\] clause 6.2.1.9.

### 5.15.14 Network Slice AS Groups support

The NG-RAN may support Network Slice AS Groups (NSAGs) which are used as
specified in TS 38.300 \[27\], TS 38.331 \[28\], TS 38.321 \[143\] and
TS 38.304 \[50\]. A Network Slice AS Group is an identifier of a group
of network slices which are associated with it. A Network Slice AS Group
association with a group of network slices may be valid in one or more
Tracking Areas. An S-NSSAI can be associated with at most one NSAG
values for Random Access and at most one NSAG value for Cell Reselection
within a Tracking Area. An S-NSSAI can be associated with different NSAG
values in different Tracking Areas.

The NG-RAN provides (and updates) the AMF with the values of the NSAG(s)
an S-NSSAI is associated with in a TA using the NG Set Up and RAN
Configuration Update procedures (see TS 38.413 \[34\]). The AMF in turn
provides this information to the NSSF. In deployments where the total
number of groups does not exceed the number of groups associated with
the NSAG size limit defined in TS 38.331 \[28\]), all the NSAGs
configured in the NG-RAN may be unique per PLMN or SNPN. If the UE has
indicated that the UE supports NSAG in the 5GMM Core Network Capability
(see clause 5.4.4a), the AMF may, with or without NSSF assistance,
configure the UE with NSAG Information for one or more S-NSSAIs in the
Configured NSSAI, by including this NSAG Information in the Registration
Accept message or the UE Configuration Command message. The UE uses the
NSAG Information as defined in clause 5.3.4.3.1. The AMF shall indicate
in the NSAG Information in which TA a specific NSAG association to
S-NSSAI(s) is valid if the AMF provides in the UE configuration a NSAG
value which is used in different TAs with a different association with
NSSAIs. The configuration the AMF provides includes at least the NSAGs
for the UE for the TAs of the Registration Area.

The UE shall store and consider the received NSAG Information, valid for
the Registered PLMN or SNPN until:

\- the UE receives new NSAG information in a Registration Accept message
or UE Configuration Command message in this PLMN or SNPN; or

\- the UE receives a Configured NSSAI without any NSAG information in
this PLMN or SNPN.

The UE shall store the currently valid NSAG information received in the
registered PLMN or SNPN when registered in this PLMN or SNPN and:

\- The UE should be able to store the NSAG information for at least the
R-PLMN and equivalent PLMNs, or the SNPN.

\- Only the RPLMN or the SNPN can provide NSAG information to the UE.

\- There can be at most 32 NSAGs configured in the UE at a time for a
PLMN or SNPN.

\- At most 4 NSAGs can have an optional TAI associated with it.

The NSAG information is not required to be stored after power off or
after the UE becomes Deregistered as it is not used for cell selection.

## 5.16 Support for specific services

### 5.16.1 Public Warning System

The functional description for supporting Public Warning System for 5G
System can be found in TS 23.041 \[46\].

### 5.16.2 SMS over NAS

#### 5.16.2.1 General

This clause includes feature description for supporting SMS over NAS in
5G System. Support for SMS incurs the following functionality:

\- Support for SMS over NAS transport between UE and AMF. This applies
to both 3GPP and Non 3GPP accesses.

\- Support for AMF determining the SMSF for a given UE.

\- Support for subscription checking and actual transmission of
MO/MT-SMS transfer by the SMSF.

\- Support for MO/MT-SMS transmission for both roaming and non-roaming
scenarios.

\- Support for selecting proper domains for MT SMS message delivery
including initial delivery and re-attempting in other domains.

#### 5.16.2.2 SMS over NAS transport

5G System supports SMS over NAS via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access.

During Registration procedure, a UE that wants to use SMS provides an
\"SMS supported\" indication over NAS signalling indicating the UE\'s
capability for SMS over NAS transport. \"SMS supported\" indication
indicates whether UE can support SMS delivery over NAS. If the core
network supports SMS functionality, the AMF includes \"SMS allowed\"
indication to the UE, and whether SMS delivery over NAS is accepted by
the network.

SMS is transported via NAS transport message, which can carry SMS
messages as payload.

### 5.16.3 IMS support

#### 5.16.3.1 General

IP-Connectivity Access Network specific concepts when using 5GS to
access IMS can be found in TS 23.228 \[15\].

5GS supports IMS with the following functionality:

\- Indication toward the UE if IMS voice over PS session is supported.

\- Capability to transport the P-CSCF address(es) to UE.

\- Paging Policy Differentiation for IMS as defined in TS 23.228 \[15\].

\- IMS emergency service as defined in TS 23.167 \[18\].

\- Domain selection for UE originating sessions.

\- Terminating domain selection for IMS voice.

\- Support of P-CSCF restoration procedure (clause 5.16.3.9).

\- NRF based P-CSCF discovery (clause 5.16.3.11).

NOTE: The NRF based P-CSCF discovery has no impact on the UE, i.e. the
UE does not need to know how P-CSCF IP address(es) is discovered in the
network.

\- NRF based HSS discovery (clause 5.16.3.12).

#### 5.16.3.2 IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over 3GPP access

The serving PLMN AMF shall send an indication toward the UE during the
Registration procedure over 3GPP access to indicate if an IMS voice over
PS session is supported or not supported in 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access. A UE with \"IMS voice over PS\" voice capability over 3GPP
access should take this indication into account when performing voice
domain selection, as described in clause 5.16.3.5.

The serving PLMN AMF may only indicate IMS voice over PS session
supported over 3GPP access in one of the following cases:

\- If the network and the UE are able to support IMS voice over PS
session in the current Registration Area with a 5G QoS Flow that
supports voice as specified in clause 5.7.

\- If the network or the UE are not able to support IMS voice over PS
session over NR connected to 5GC, but is able for one of the following:

\- If the network and the UE are able to support IMS voice over PS
session over E-UTRA connected to 5GC, and the NG-RAN supports a handover
or redirection to E-UTRA connected to 5GC for this UE at QoS Flow
establishment for IMS voice;

\- If the UE supports handover to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice, and
the NG-RAN supports a handover to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow
establishment for IMS voice; or

\- If the UE supports redirection to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice,
and the NG-RAN supports redirection to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow
establishment for IMS voice.

\- If the network is not able to provide a successful IMS voice over PS
session over E-UTRA connected to 5GC, but is able for one of the
following:

\- If the UE supports handover to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice, and
the NG-RAN supports a handover to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow
establishment for IMS voice; or

\- If the UE supports redirection to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice,
and the NG-RAN supports redirection to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow
establishment for IMS voice.

The serving PLMN provides this indication based e.g. on local policy, UE
capabilities, HPLMN, whether IP address preservation is possible,
whether NG-RAN to UTRAN SRVCC is supported and how extended NG-RAN
coverage is, and the Voice Support Match Indicator from the NG-RAN (see
clause 4.2.8a of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

NOTE 1: The terms \"UE supports handover to EPS\" or \"UE supports
redirection to EPS\" used above also consider the case that the UE has
signalled that S1 mode is enabled. In case the UE has signalled that S1
mode is disabled for a network that only supports IMS voice via EPS
Fallback, the AMF will not indicate that IMS voice over PS session is
supported over 3GPP access. A voice centric UE ensures its voice service
as described in clauses 5.16.3.5 and 5.16.3.6.

The AMF in serving PLMN shall indicate that IMS voice over PS is
supported only if the serving PLMN has a roaming agreement that covers
support of IMS voice with the HPLMN. This indication is per Registration
Area.

NOTE 2: If the network supports EPS fallback for voice the 5GC can be
configured not to perform the Voice Support Match Indicator procedure in
order to set the IMS voice over PS session Supported Indication.

The serving SNPN provides the IMS voice over PS indication based e.g. on
local policy, UE capabilities, whether IP address preservation is
possible, and how extended NR coverage is. This indication is per
Registration Area.

NOTE 3: Since in SNPN access mode there is only support for NR and the
\"voice centric\" UE cannot reselect to another RAT in the same
registered SNPN if the first Registration Area that the UE tries to
register from cannot support IMS voice, it is recommended that support
for IMS voice is provided homogeneously in the whole SNPN if at all.

#### 5.16.3.2a IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over non-3GPP access

The serving PLMN AMF shall send an indication toward the UE during the
Registration procedure over non-3GPP access to indicate whether an IMS
voice over PS session is supported or not supported via non-3GPP access.
A UE with \"IMS voice over PS\" voice capability over non-3GPP access
should take this indication (received in the Registration procedure
performed over either 3GPP access or Non-3GPP access) into account when
performing the selection between N3IWF/TNGF and ePDG described in
clause 6.3.6.

The serving PLMN AMF may only indicate IMS voice over PS session
supported over non-3GPP access if the network is able to provide a
successful IMS voice over PS session over N3IWF/TNGF connected to 5GC
with a 5G QoS Flow that supports voice as specified in clause 5.7.

#### 5.16.3.3 Homogeneous support for IMS voice over PS Session supported indication

5GC shall support the usage of \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over
PS Sessions\" indication between AMF and UDM.

When the AMF initiates Nudm_UECM_Registration operation to the UDM, it
shall:

\- if \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" is supported homogeneously in all
TAs in the serving AMF for the UE, include the \"Homogeneous Support of
IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication set to \"Supported\";

\- if none of the TAs of the serving AMF supports \"IMS Voice over PS
Sessions\" for the UE, include the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice
over PS Sessions\" indication set to \"Not supported\";

\- if \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" support is either non-homogeneous
or unknown, not include the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS
Sessions\" indication.

The AMF shall be able to provide the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice
over PS Sessions\" indication as described above to the UDM using
Nudm_UECM_Update operation as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The UDM shall take this indication into account when doing Terminating
Access Domain Selection (T-ADS) procedure for IMS voice.

NOTE: A TA supports \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" if the serving AMF
indicates IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over 3GPP
access to the UE, as described in clause 5.16.3.2. In order to support
routing of incoming IMS voice calls to the correct domain, the
network-based T-ADS (see TS 23.292 \[63\] and TS 23.221 \[23\]) requires
that the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\"
indication is set to \"Supported\" for all registered TAs of the UE or
\"Not supported\" for all registered TAs of the UE.

#### 5.16.3.4 P-CSCF address delivery

At PDU Session Establishment procedure related to IMS, SMF shall support
the capability to send the P-CSCF address(es) to UE. The SMF is located
in VPLMN if LBO is used. This is sent by visited SMF if LBO is used. For
Home routed, this information is sent by the SMF in HPLMN. P-CSCF
address(es) shall be sent transparently through AMF, and in the case of
Home Routed also through the SMF in VPLMN. The P-CSCF IP address(es) may
be locally configured in the SMF, or discovered using NRF as described
in clause 5.16.3.11.

NOTE 1: Other options to provide P-CSCF to the UE as defined in
TS 23.228 \[15\] is not excluded.

NOTE 2: PDU Session for IMS is identified by \"APN\" or \"DNN\".

In the case of SNPN access the SMF is always located in the serving SNPN
(no support for Home Routed traffic); therefore, the serving SMF sends
the P-CSCF address(es) to the UE.

#### 5.16.3.5 Domain selection for UE originating sessions / calls

For UE originating calls, the 5GC capable UE performs access domain
selection. The UE shall be able to take following factors into account
for access domain selection decision:

\- The state of the UE in the IMS. The state information shall include:
Registered, Unregistered.

\- The \"IMS voice over PS session supported indication\" as defined in
clause 5.16.3.2.

\- Whether the UE is expected to behave in a \"voice centric\" or \"data
centric\" way for 5GS.

\- UE capability of supporting IMS PS voice.

\- UE capability for operating in dual-registration mode with selective
PDU Session transfer as defined in clause 5.17.2.3.3.

\- Whether 3GPP PS Data Off is active or not and whether IMS voice is
included in 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services or not as defined in
clause 5.24.

NOTE 1: In this release of the specification, the exact logic of which
PDU sessions are kept in which system for Dual Registration UE with
selective transfer of certain PDU Sessions as defined in
clause 5.17.2.3.3, is left up to UE implementation. The voice centric UE
will keep the PDU Session used for IMS services to a system that
supports voice over IMS. The voice centric UE can re-register with the
IMS (if needed) when the IMS PDU session is transferred between 5GS and
EPS.

To allow for appropriate domain selection for originating voice calls,
the UE shall attempt Initial Registration in 5GC. If the UE fails to use
IMS for voice, e.g. due to \"IMS voice over PS session supported
indication\" indicates voice is not supported in 5G System, the UE
behaves as described below for \"voice centric\" for 5GS or \"data
centric\" for 5GS:

\- A UE set to \"voice centric\" for 5GS shall always try to ensure that
Voice service is possible. A voice centric 5GC capable and EPC capable
UE unable to obtain voice service in 5GS shall not select a cell
connected only to 5GC. By disabling capabilities to access 5GS, the UE
re-selects to E‑UTRAN connected to EPC first (if available). When the UE
selects E-UTRAN connected to EPC, the UE performs Voice Domain Selection
procedures as defined in TS 23.221 \[23\].

\- A UE set to \"data centric\" for 5GS does not need to perform any
reselection if voice services cannot be obtained.

NOTE 2: The related radio capabilities in order for the voice centric UE
to not reselect to NR or E-UTRA cell connected to 5GC (i.e. avoid ping
pong) will be defined by RAN WGs.

#### 5.16.3.6 Terminating domain selection for IMS voice

When requested by IMS, the UDM/HSS shall be able to query the serving
AMF for T-ADS related information. T-ADS is a functionality located in
the IMS and is performed as specified in TS 23.221 \[23\].

The AMF shall respond to the query with the following information unless
the UE is detached:

\- whether or not IMS voice over PS Session is supported in the
registration area (s) where the UE is currently registered;

\- whether or not IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over
non-3GPP access is supported in the WLAN where the UE is currently
registered;

\- the time of the last radio contact with the UE; and

\- the current Access Type and RAT type.

#### 5.16.3.7 UE\'s usage setting

If the UE is configured to support IMS voice, the UE shall include the
information element \"UE\'s usage setting\" in Registration Request
messages. The UE\'s usage setting indicates whether the UE behaves in a
\"voice centric\" or \"data centric\" way (as defined in
clause 5.16.3.5).

A UE supporting IMS voice over 3GPP access connected to 5GC and that is
EPS capable shall also support IMS voice over E-UTRA connected to EPC.

NOTE: Depending on operator\'s configuration, the UE\'s usage setting
can be used by the network to choose the RFSP Index in use (see
clause 5.3.4.3). As an example, this enables the enforcement of
selective idle mode camping over E-UTRA for voice centric UEs.

#### 5.16.3.8 Domain and Access Selection for UE originating SMS

##### 5.16.3.8.1 UE originating SMS for IMS Capable UEs supporting SMS over IP

To allow for appropriate domain selection for SMS delivery, it should be
possible to provision UEs with the following HPLMN operator preferences
on how an IMS enabled UE is supposed to handle SMS services:

\- SMS is not to be invoked over IP networks: the UE does not attempt to
deliver SMS over IP networks. The UE attempts to deliver SMS over NAS
signalling.

\- SMS is preferred to be invoked over IP networks: the UE attempts to
deliver SMS over IP networks. If delivery of SMS over IP networks is not
available, the UE attempts to deliver SMS over NAS signalling.

##### 5.16.3.8.2 Access Selection for SMS over NAS

It should be possible to provision UEs with the HPLMN SMS over NAS
operator preferences on access selection for delivering SMS over NAS
signalling.

Based on the SMS over NAS preference:

\- SMS is preferred to be invoked over 3GPP access for NAS transport:
the UE attempts to deliver MO SMS over NAS via 3GPP access if the UE is
both registered in 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

\- SMS is preferred to be invoked over non-3GPP access for NAS
transport: the UE attempts to deliver MO SMS over NAS via non-3GPP
access if the UE is both registered in 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
If delivery of SMS over NAS via non-3GPP access is not available, the UE
attempts to deliver SMS over NAS via 3GPP access.

#### 5.16.3.9 SMF support for P-CSCF restoration procedure

For the support of P-CSCF restoration the SMF behaves as described in
TS 23.380 \[61\].

#### 5.16.3.10 IMS Voice Service via EPS Fallback or RAT fallback in 5GS

In order to support various deployment scenarios for obtaining IMS voice
service, the UE and NG-RAN may support the mechanism to direct or
redirect the UE from NG-RAN either towards E-UTRA connected to 5GC (RAT
fallback) or towards EPS (E-UTRAN connected to EPC System fallback).

Following principles apply for IMS Voice Service:

\- The serving AMF indicates toward the UE during the Registration
procedure that IMS voice over PS session is supported.

\- If a request for establishing the QoS Flow for IMS voice reaches the
NG-RAN, the NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the establishment
request and the NG-RAN may trigger one of the following procedures
depending on UE capabilities, N26 availability, network configuration
and radio conditions:

\- Redirection to EPS;

\- Handover procedure to EPS;

\- Redirection to E-UTRA connected to 5GC; or

\- Handover to E-UTRA connected to 5GC.

\- If needed, Network Provided Location Information is provided as
described in clauses 4.13.6.1 and 4.13.6.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- The ongoing IMS voice session is not impacted by a change of the IMS
voice over PS session indicator from supported to unsupported (e.g. the
UE receives during RAT Fallback or EPS Fallback the IMS voice over PS
session indicator indicating that IMS voice over PS sessions are not
supported).

NOTE: Any change in IMS voice over PS session indicator applies to new
IMS sessions initiated only after the ongoing IMS voice session is
terminated.

During any release of RRC connection including after EPS/RAT fallback is
performed, the eNB or NG-RAN node may provide to the UE dedicated idle
mode priorities for NR as defined in TS 36.331 \[51\] taking into
account RFSP, PLMNs contained in Handover Restriction List and local
operator policy. If the UE remains ECM/CM connected after the voice call
has ended, the eNB or NG-RAN node may trigger handover to NR connected
to 5GC, if configured to do so, taking into account local operator
policy and Handover Restriction List.

#### 5.16.3.11 P-CSCF discovery and selection

P-CSCF selection functionality may be used by the SMF to select the
P-CSCF for an IMS PDU Session of the UE.

The SMF can utilize the Network Repository Function to discover the
P-CSCF instance(s). The NRF provides the IP address or the FQDN of
P-CSCF instance(s) to the SMF. The P-CSCF selection function in the SMF
selects the P-CSCF instance(s) based on the available P-CSCF instances
obtained from NRF or based on the configured P-CSCF information in the
SMF. If the SMF receives FQDN(s) from the NRF or is configured with
FQDN(s) the SMF shall resolve these to IP addresses for sending to the
UE in the PDU session response.

The following factors may be considered during the P-CSCF discovery and
selection:

\- S-NSSAI of the PDU Session.

\- UE location information.

\- Local operator policies.

\- Availability of candidate P-CSCFs.

\- UE IP address.

\- Access Type.

\- Proximity to location of selected UPF.

\- Selected Data Network Name (DNN).

#### 5.16.3.12 HSS discovery and selection

HSS discovery and selection functionality is used by the
I-CSCF/S-CSCF/IMS-AS to select an HSS that manages the user\'s IMS
subscriptions and has the ability to serve the IMS services for the UE,
see clause AA.3.3 of TS 23.228 \[15\] and clause 6.3.1 for details.

### 5.16.4 Emergency Services

#### 5.16.4.1 Introduction

Emergency Services are provided to support IMS emergency sessions.
\"Emergency Services\" refers to functionalities provided by the serving
network when the network is configured to support Emergency Services.
Emergency Services are provided to normally registered UEs and to
Emergency Registered UEs, that can be either normally registered or in
limited service state. Depending on local regulation, receiving
Emergency Services in limited service state does not require a valid
subscription. Depending on local regulation and on operator\'s policy,
the network may allow or reject a registration request for Emergency
Services (i.e. Emergency Registration) from UEs that have been
identified to be in limited service state. Four different behaviours of
Emergency Services as defined in clause 4.3.12.1 of TS 23.401 \[26\] are
supported.

Emergency Services shall not be provided to a UE over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access concurrently, except for the following case:

\- a UE may be Emergency Registered and have an emergency PDU session
over non-3GPP access or may be attached for emergency session to ePDG
over untrusted WLAN (as defined in TS 23.402 \[43\]) when 3GPP access
becomes available. In which case the UE may have to register over 3GPP
access and check first the support for Emergency Services over the 3GPP
RAT it has selected (e.g. based on Emergency Services Support
indication, Emergency Services Fallback, AS broadcast indicator). If
there is native support for Emergency Services in the selected 3GPP RAT
the UE will attempt to transfer the emergency PDU session from non-3GPP
access to 3GPP access (see clause 4.9.2 or clause 4.9.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]). If there is no native support for Emergency Services
in the selected RAT, but Emergency Services Fallback to another RAT in
5GS or to another System where Emergency Services may be supported
(based on the conditions defined in clause 5.16.4.11), the UE may
trigger first Emergency Services Fallback (see clause 4.13.4.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]) and then attempt to transfer the emergency PDU session
from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access (see clause 4.9.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]). In these cases the UE may thus briefly be emergency
registered and receive emergency services over both 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access concurrently.

A UE may only attempt to use Emergency Services over non-3GPP access if
it is unable to use Emergency Services over 3GPP access as specified in
TS 23.167 \[18\].

The UE is only allowed to have one PDU session for Emergency services at
a time. A PDU Session cannot be changed between a PDU Session for
Non-Emergency services and a PDU Session for Emergency services. PDU
session for emergency services can be transferred from one Access Type
to another as specified in clause 5.16.4.9.

To provide Emergency Services, the AMF is configured with Emergency
Configuration Data that are applied to Emergency Services that are
established by an AMF based on request from the UE. The AMF Emergency
Configuration Data contains the S-NSSAI and Emergency DNN which is used
to derive an SMF. In addition, the AMF Emergency Configuration Data may
contain the statically configured SMF for the Emergency DNN. The SMF may
also store Emergency Configuration Data that contains statically
configured UPF information for the Emergency DNN.

NOTE 1: The Network slices associated with emergency services are
assumed to be configured consistently in the AMF (i.e. emergency
configuration data) and NG-RAN nodes within the corresponding
Registration Area where emergency services are to be supported.

When the UE is camped normally in the cell, i.e. not in limited service
state, during Registration procedure described in clause 4.2.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\], the serving AMF includes an indication for Emergency
Services Support within the Registration Accept to the UE. For 3GPP
access, the Emergency Services Support indication is valid within the
current Registration Area per RAT (i.e. this is to cover cases when the
same registration area supports multiple RATs and they have different
capability).

The Emergency Services Support is configured in the AMF according to
local regulations and network capabilities. AMF includes Emergency
Services Support indicator in the Registration Accept message to
indicate that the UE can setup emergency PDU Session to obtain emergency
services. The AMF may include additional local emergency numbers
associated with the serving network for the UE, further defined in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

During Registration procedures over 3GPP access in a PLMN, the 5GC
includes the Emergency Services Support indicator, valid for the current
Registration Area and indicating per RAT that Emergency Services are
supported if any of the following conditions is true within the current
Registration Area:

\- the Network is able to support Emergency Services natively over 5GS;

\- E-UTRA connected to 5GC supports IMS Emergency Services (e.g. voice),
and the NG-RAN is able to trigger handover or redirection from NR to
E-UTRA connected to 5GC at QoS Flow establishment for IMS Emergency
Services (e.g. voice);

\- NG-RAN is able to trigger handover to EPS at QoS Flow establishment
for IMS Emergency Services (e.g. voice);

\- NG-RAN is able to trigger redirection to EPS at QoS Flow
establishment for IMS Emergency Services (e.g. voice); or

\- NG-RAN is able to trigger 5G SRVCC handover to UTRAN for IMS
Emergency Services (i.e. voice).

During Registration procedures over non-3GPP access, the 5GC indicates
that Emergency Services are supported if the Network is able to support
Emergency Services natively over 5GS.

In the case of SNPN, during Registration procedures over 3GPP access,
the 5GC includes the Emergency Services Support indicator, valid for the
current Registration Area indicating that Emergency Services are
supported if the following condition is true within the current
Registration Area:

\- the Network is able to support Emergency Services natively over 5GS.

The 5GC includes an indication per RAT whether it supports Emergency
Services Fallback (as defined in clause 5.16.4.11) to another RAT in 5GS
or to another System where Emergency Services are supported natively.
The Emergency Services Fallback support indicator is valid within the
current Registration Area per RAT.

If a certain RAT is restricted for Emergency Services, AMF signals that
the corresponding RAT is restricted for Emergency Services Support to
the Master RAN Node. This helps assist the Master RAN node determine
whether to set up Dual Connectivity for Emergency Services.

UEs that are in limited service state, as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\],
or that camp normally on a cell but failed to register successfully to
the network under conditions specified in TS 24.501 \[47\], initiate the
Registration procedure by indicating that the registration is to receive
Emergency Services, referred to as Emergency Registration, and a
Follow-on request is included in the Registration Request to initiate
PDU Session Establishment procedure with a Request Type indicating
\"Emergency Request\". UEs that had registered for normal services and
do not have emergency PDU Session established and that are subject to
Mobility Restriction in the present area or RAT (e.g. because of
restricted tracking area) shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure to receive Emergency Services, i.e. with a
Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\". Based on local
regulation, the network supporting Emergency Services for UEs in limited
service state provides Emergency Services to these UE, regardless
whether the UE can be authenticated, has roaming or Mobility
Restrictions or a valid subscription.

For Emergency Services over 3GPP access via PLMN, other than eCall over
IMS, the UEs in limited service state that do not operate in SNPN access
mode determine that the cell supports Emergency Services over NG-RAN
from a broadcast indicator in AS. The cell connected to EPC and 5GC
broadcasts separate broadcast indicator for EPC and 5GC to indicate
support of emergency services by the EPC and 5GC. If the UE supports
SNPN access mode, is in limited service state, is not operating in SNPN
access mode, needs to make an emergency call and cannot find an
acceptable cell in any PLMN, the UE may activate SNPN access mode and
attempt to camp on an acceptable cell of any available SNPN supporting
emergency calls (irrespective of SNPN ID or GIN) as defined in
TS 23.122 \[17\]. For Emergency Services over untrusted non-3GPP access,
other than eCall over IMS, the UE in limited service state selects any
N3IWF as specified in clause 6.3.6. Emergency calls for eCall Over IMS
may only be performed if the UE has a USIM.

For Emergency Services over NR via SNPN, other than eCall over IMS, the
UEs in limited service state that operate in SNPN access mode determine
that the cell supports Emergency Services over NR from a broadcast
indicator in AS and indication that the SNPN supports Emergency
Services. If the UE operates in SNPN access mode and is in limited
service state, the UE shall attempt to camp on an acceptable cell of any
available SNPN supporting emergency calls (irrespective of SNPN ID or
GIN). If the UE cannot find acceptable cell on any available SNPN, the
UE shall deactivate SNPN access mode and camp on any available PLMN cell
supporting emergency calls (irrespective of PLMN ID) as defined in
TS 23.122 \[17\].

For NR satellite access, if a UE in limited service state is aware of
its location, the UE selects a PLMN that is allowed to operate in the UE
location as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\]. The network may be configured
to verify the location of a UE that is registering for emergency
services as specified in clause 5.4.11.4.

There is no support for eCall over IMS for SNPNs in this Release.

A serving network shall provide an Access Stratum broadcast indication
from NG-RAN (NR or E-UTRA connected to 5GC) to UEs indicating whether
eCall Over IMS is supported:

\- When an E-UTRA cell is connected to EPC and 5GC, the cell broadcasts
separate Access stratum broadcast indication for 5GC and EPC to indicate
support of eCall over IMS by 5GC and EPC.

\- A UE that is not in limited service state determines that the NG-RAN
cell supports eCall Over IMS via 5GC using the broadcast indicator for
eCall over IMS. Emergency calls for eCall over IMS are not supported
over non-3GPP access.

NOTE 2: The Access Stratum broadcast indicator is determined according
to operator policies and minimally indicates that the PLMN, or all of
the PLMNs in the case of network sharing, and at least one emergency
centre or PSAP to which an eCall Over IMS can be routed, support eCall
Over IMS.

\- A UE in limited service state determines that the cell supports eCall
Over IMS using both the broadcast indicator for support of Emergency
Services over NG-RAN and the broadcast indicator of NG-RAN for eCall
over IMS. Emergency calls for eCall Over IMS are not supported over
Non-3GPP access and NR via SNPN.

NOTE 3: The broadcast indicator for eCall Over IMS does not indicate
whether UEs in limited service state are supported. So, the broadcast
indicator for support of Emergency Services over NG-RAN that indicates
limited service state support needs to be applied in addition.

For a UE that is Emergency Registered, if it is unauthenticated the
security context is not set up on UE.

In order to receive Emergency Services, UEs that camp on a suitable cell
in RM-DEREGISTERED state (i.e. without any conditions that result in
limited service state), or that decide to access 5GC via non-3GPP access
(and not in limited service state over non-3GPP access), initiate the
Initial Registration procedure for normal service instead of Emergency
Registration. Upon successful registration, such UEs shall initiate the
UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure with a Request Type
indicating \"Emergency Request\" to receive Emergency Services if the
AMF indicated support for Emergency Services in 5GC (for the RAT the UE
is currently camped on when UE is camping on 3GPP access). The UEs that
camp normally on a cell or that are connected via Non-3GPP access are
informed that the PLMN supports Emergency Services over 5G-AN from the
Emergency Services Support indicator in the Registration procedure. This
applies to both 3GPP and non-3GPP Access Types. There is no support for
Emergency Services for SNPN that is accessed via NWu from a PLMN.

NOTE 4: The Emergency Services Support indicator in the Registration
procedures does not indicate support for eCall Over IMS.

For a UE that is Emergency Registered, normal PLMN or SNPN selection
principles apply after the end of the IMS emergency session.

NOTE 5: For Emergency Services, there is no support for inter PLMN
mobility thus there is a risk of service disruption due to failed inter
PLMN mobility attempts when there is no session continuity (e.g. change
of anchor SMF/UPF due to mobility) for the PDU Session and/or based on
operator policies.

NOTE 6 Based on operator policies, Inter PLMN mobility with session
continuity can be supported for Emergency Services if the anchor SMF/UPF
for PDU Session supporting Emergency Services does not change.

The UE shall set the RRC establishment cause to emergency as defined in
TS 38.331 \[28\] when it requests an RRC Connection in relation to an
emergency session.

In the case of Limited Service state, UE shall not include any Network
Slice related parameters when communicating with the network.

When a PLMN or SNPN supports IMS and Emergency Services:

\- all AMFs in that PLMN or SNPN shall have the capability to support
Emergency Services.

\- at least one SMF shall have this capability.

For other emergency scenarios (e.g. UE autonomous selection for
initiating Emergency Services), refer to TS 23.167 \[18\] for domain
selection principles.

For emergency service support in Public network integrated NPNs, refer
to clause 5.30.3.5.

#### 5.16.4.2 Architecture Reference Model for Emergency Services

According to clause 4.2, the non-roaming architectures (Figure 4.2.3-1
and Figure 4.2.3-2) and roaming architecture with the visited
operator\'s application function (Figure 4.2.4-1 and Figure 4.2.4-4)
apply for Emergency Services. The other non-roaming and roaming
architectures with services provided by the home network do not apply
for Emergency Services.

#### 5.16.4.3 Mobility Restrictions and Access Restrictions for Emergency Services

When Emergency Services are supported and local regulation requires IMS
Emergency Sessions to be provided regardless of Mobility Restrictions or
Access Restrictions, the Mobility Restrictions or Access Restrictions
(see clause 5.3.4.1) should not be applied to UEs receiving Emergency
Services. Additionally, due to Mobility Restrictions or Access
Restrictions (e.g. CAG restrictions) for normally registered UEs, that
have established both non-emergency PDU Sessions and emergency PDU
Session, the AMF indicates to the SMF to perform a local release of all
non-emergency PDU Sessions via PDU Session Release procedure as
specified in clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The UE locally releases
non-emergency PDU Sessions. The AMF and the UE behave as if the UE is
emergency registered as described in TS 24.501 \[47\].

When the (R)AN resources for Emergency Services are established, the ARP
value for Emergency Services indicates the usage for Emergency Services
to the 5G-AN.

During handover, the source NG-RAN and source AMF ignore any UE related
restrictions during handover evaluation when there is an active PDU
Session associated with emergency service.

During Mobility Registration Update procedures, including a Mobility
Registration Update as part of a handover, the target AMF ignores any
Mobility Restrictions or access restrictions for UE with emergency
services where required by local regulation. Any non-emergency services
are not allowed, by the target network when not allowed by the
subscription for the target location. To allow the UE in limited service
state (either Emergency Registered or registered for normal service)
over a given Access Type to get access to normal services over this
Access Type after the Emergency Session has ended and when it has moved
to a new area that is not stored by the UE as a forbidden area, after
allowing a period of time for subsequent Emergency Services, the UE may
explicitly deregister and register for normal services over this Access
Type without waiting for the emergency PDU Session Release by the SMF.

This functionality applies to all mobility procedures.

#### 5.16.4.4 Reachability Management

Over 3GPP access, an Emergency Registered UE when its Periodic
Registration Update timer expires shall not initiate a Periodic
Registration Update procedure but shall enter the RM-DEREGISTERED state.
For such UEs, the AMF runs a mobile reachable timer with a similar value
to the UE\'s Periodic Registration Update timer. After expiry of this
timer the AMF may change the UE RM state for 3GPP Access in the AMF to
RM-DEREGISTERED. The AMF assigns the Periodic Registration Update timer
value to Emergency Registered UEs. This timer keeps the Emergency
Registered UE registered for Emergency Services after change to CM-IDLE
state to allow for a subsequent Emergency Service without a need for a
new Emergency Registration.

Over non-3GPP access, an Emergency Registered UE is only reachable in
CM-CONNECTED state: since the UE may only use Emergency Services over
Non-3GPP access when it is not possible over 3GPP access, 3GPP access is
assumed to be unavailable for paging the UE.

#### 5.16.4.5 SMF and UPF selection function for Emergency Services

When a SMF is selected for Emergency Services, the SMF selection
function described in clause 6.3.2 for normal services is applied to the
Emergency DNN or the AMF selects the SMF directly from the AMF Emergency
Configuration Data. If the SMF selection function described in
clause 6.3.2 is used it shall always derive a SMF in the Serving PLMN or
SNPN, which guarantees that the IP address is also allocated by the
Serving PLMN or SNPN. When a UPF is selected for Emergency Services, the
UPF selection function described in clause 6.3.3 for normal services is
applied to the Emergency DNN or the SMF selects the UPF directly from
the SMF Emergency Configuration Data. The information in the AMF
Emergency Configuration Data and the SMF Emergency Configuration Data is
specified in clause 5.16.4.1.

#### 5.16.4.6 QoS for Emergency Services

Local regulation may require supporting emergency calls from an
unauthorised UE. In such a case, the SMF may not have subscription data.
Additionally, the local network may want to provide Emergency Services
support differently than what is allowed by a UE subscription.
Therefore, the initial QoS parameters used for establishing Emergency
Services are configured in the V-SMF (local network) in the SMF
Emergency Configuration Data.

This functionality is used by the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment
procedure when establishing Emergency Services.

#### 5.16.4.7 PCC for Emergency Services

Dynamic PCC is used for UEs establishing emergency service and shall be
used to manage IMS emergency sessions when an operator allows IMS
emergency sessions. When establishing Emergency Services with a SMF, the
PCF provides the SMF with the QoS parameters, including an ARP value
reserved for the Emergency Services to prioritize the QoS Flows when
performing admission control, as defined in TS 23.503 \[45\].

The PCF rejects an IMS session established via the emergency PDU Session
if the AF (i.e. P-CSCF) does not provide an emergency indication to the
PCF.

#### 5.16.4.8 IP Address Allocation

Emergency service is provided by the serving PLMN or SNPN. The UE and
serving PLMN or SNPN must have compatible IP address versions in order
for the UE to obtain a local emergency PDU Session.

#### 5.16.4.9 Handling of PDU Sessions for Emergency Services

The QoS Flows of a PDU Session associated with the emergency DNN shall
be dedicated for IMS emergency sessions and shall not allow any other
type of traffic. The emergency contexts shall not be changed to
non-emergency contexts and vice versa. The UPF shall block any traffic
that is not from or to addresses of network functions (e.g. P-CSCF)
providing Emergency Services. If there is already an emergency PDU
Session over a given Access Type (3GPP access or non-3GPP access), the
UE shall not request another emergency PDU Session over the other Access
Type except for handing over the existing emergency PDU Session to this
other Access Type. The network shall reject any emergency PDU Session
requests over a given Access Type (3GPP access or non-3GPP access) if it
knows the UE already has an emergency PDU Session over the other Access
Type. The ARP reserved for emergency service shall only be assigned to
QoS Flows associated with an emergency PDU Session. If the UE is
Emergency Registered over a given access, it shall not request a PDU
Session to any other DNN over this access.

#### 5.16.4.9a Handling of PDU Sessions for normal services for Emergency Registered UEs

For an Emergency Registered UE over a given Access Type:

\- the UE shall not initiate the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment
procedure for normal service over this Access Type; and

\- the network shall reject any PDU Session Establishment request for
normal service from the UE on this Access Type;

\- the UE may attempt to receive normal service over another Access Type
if not otherwise prevented by the present document.

#### 5.16.4.10 Support of eCall Only Mode

For service requirements for eCall only mode, refer to TS 22.101 \[33\].

A UE configured for eCall Only Mode shall remain in RM-DEREGISTERED
state, shall camp on a network cell when available but shall refrain
from any Registration Management, Connection Management or other
signalling with the network. The UE may instigate Registration
Management and Connection Management procedures in order to establish,
maintain and release an eCall Over IMS session or a session to any
non-emergency MSISDN(s) or URI(s) configured in the USIM for test and/or
terminal reconfiguration services. Following the release of either
session, the UE starts a timer whose value depends on the type of
session (i.e. whether eCall or a session to a non-emergency MSISDN or
URI for test/reconfiguration). While the timer is running, the UE shall
perform normal RM/CM procedures and is permitted to respond to paging to
accept and establish an incoming session (e.g. from an emergency centre,
PSAP or HPLMN operator). When the timer expires, the UE shall perform a
UE-initiated Deregistration procedure if still registered and enter
RM-DEREGISTERED state.

NOTE 1: An HPLMN operator can change the eCall Only Mode configuration
state of a UE in the USIM. An HPLMN operator can also instead add,
modify or remove a non-emergency MSISDN or URI in the USIM for test
and/or terminal reconfiguration services. This can occur following a UE
call to a non-emergency MSISDN or URI configured for reconfiguration.
When the eCall Only Mode configuration is removed, the UE operates as a
normal UE that can support eCall over IMS.

NOTE 2: A test call and a reconfiguration call can be seen as normal
(non-emergency) call by a serving PLMN and normal charging rules can
apply depending on operator policy.

NOTE 3: An MSISDN configured in the USIM for test and/or terminal
reconfiguration services for eCall Over IMS can differ from an MSISDN
configured in the USIM for test services for eCall over the CS domain.

#### 5.16.4.11 Emergency Services Fallback

In order to support various deployment scenarios for obtaining Emergency
Services, the UE and 5GC may support the mechanism to direct or redirect
the UE either towards E-UTRA connected to 5GC (RAT fallback) when only
NR does not support Emergency Services or towards EPS (E-UTRAN connected
to EPC System fallback) when the 5GC does not support Emergency
Services. Emergency Services fallback may be used when the 5GS does not
indicate support for Emergency Services (see clause 5.16.4.1) and
indicates support for Emergency Services fallback.

Following principles apply for Emergency Services Fallback:

\- If the AMF indicates support for Emergency Services fallback in the
Registration Accept message, then in order to initiate Emergency
Service, normally registered UE supporting Emergency Services fallback
shall initiate a Service Request with Service Type set to Emergency
Services fallback as defined in clause 4.13.4.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- AMF uses the Service Type Indication within the Service Request to
redirect the UE towards the appropriate RAT/System. The 5GS may, for
Emergency Services, trigger one of the following procedures:

\- Handover or redirection to EPS.

\- Handover or redirection to E-UTRA connected to 5GC.

\- After receiving the Service Request for Emergency Fallback, the AMF
triggers N2 procedure resulting in either CONNECTED state mobility
(Handover procedure) or IDLE state mobility (redirection) to either
E-UTRA/5GC or to E-UTRAN/EPC depending on factors such as N26
availability, network configuration and radio conditions. In the N2
procedure, the AMF based on support for Emergency Services in 5GC or EPC
may indicate the target CN for the RAN node to know whether inter-RAT
fallback or inter-system fallback is to be performed. The target CN
indicated in the N2 procedure is also conveyed to the UE in order to be
able to perform the appropriate NAS procedures (S1 or N1 Mode).

\- When the AS re-keying procedure and the Emergency Fallback procedure
collides, the AMF gives up the AS re-keying procedure and only initiates
the Emergency Fallback procedure.

NOTE 1: Emergency Services Fallback to EPS can be followed by an onward
movement to GERAN or UTRAN via CSFB procedures if the PLMN does not
support IMS emergency services.

NOTE 2: If the UE has signalled that S1 mode is disabled for a network
that only supports IMS voice via EPS Fallback, the AMF will not indicate
that Emergency Services Fallback is supported over 3GPP access.

Emergency Services fallback is supported only in case of PLMN. Emergency
Services Fallback is not supported for SNPN.

### 5.16.5 Multimedia Priority Services

TS 22.153 \[24\] specifies the service requirements for Multimedia
Priority Service (MPS). MPS allows Service Users (as per
TS 22.153 \[24\]) priority access to system resources in situations such
as during congestion, creating the ability to deliver or complete
sessions of a high priority nature. Service Users are
government-authorized personnel, emergency management officials and/or
other authorized users. MPS supports priority sessions on an
\"end-to-end\" priority basis.

MPS is based on the ability to invoke, modify, maintain and release
sessions with priority, and deliver the priority media packets under
network congestion conditions. MPS is supported in a roaming environment
when roaming agreements are in place and where regulatory requirements
apply.

NOTE 1: If a session terminates on a server in the Internet (e.g.
web-based service), then the remote end and the Internet transport are
out of scope for this specification.

A Service User may use an MPS-subscribed UE or any other UE to obtain
MPS. An MPS-subscribed UE obtains priority access to the Radio Access
Network by using the Unified Access Control mechanism according to
TS 22.261 \[2\]. This mechanism provides preferential access to UEs
based on its assigned Access Identity. If an MPS-subscribed UE belongs
to the special Access Identity as defined in TS 22.261 \[2\], the UE has
preferential access to the network compared to ordinary UEs in periods
of congestion.

MPS subscription allows users to receive priority services, if the
network supports MPS. MPS subscription entitles a USIM with special
Access Identity. MPS subscription includes indication for support of
priority PDU connectivity service including MPS for Data Transport
Service and IMS priority service support for the end user. Priority
Level regarding QoS Flows and IMS are also part of the MPS subscription
information. The usage of Priority Level is defined in TS 22.153 \[24\],
TS 23.503 \[45\] and TS 23.228 \[15\].

NOTE 2: The term \"Priority PDU connectivity services\" is used to refer
to 5G System functionality that corresponds to the functionality as
provided by LTE/EPC Priority EPS bearer services in clause 4.3.18.3 of
TS 23.401 \[26\].

MPS includes signalling priority and media priority. All MPS-subscribed
UEs get priority for QoS Flows (e.g. used for IMS signalling) when
established to the DN that is configured to have priority for a given
Service User by setting MPS-appropriate values in the QoS profile in the
UDM.

Service Users are treated as On Demand MPS subscribers or not, based on
regional/national regulatory requirements. On Demand service is based on
Service User invocation/revocation explicitly and applied to the media
QoS Flows being established. When not On Demand MPS service does not
require invocation, and provides priority treatment for all QoS Flows
only to the DN that is configured to have priority for a given Service
User after attachment to the 5G network.

MPS for Data Transport Service is an on-demand service that may be
invoked/revoked by an authorized Service User using a UE with a
subscription for MPS (i.e. according to its MPS profile), or using a UE
that does not have a subscription for MPS (using methods not in scope of
this specification).

MPS for Data Transport Service requires explicit invocation. The Service
User invokes the service by communicating with an AF. The authorization
of an MPS for Data Transport Service request is done by the AF or the
PCF according to clause 6.1.3.11 of TS 23.503 \[45\]. Upon successful
authorization, the PCF performs the necessary actions to achieve
appropriate ARP and 5QI settings for the QoS Flows (see clause 6.1.3.11
of TS 23.503 \[45\]).

MPS for Data Transport Service enables the prioritization of all traffic
on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows
upon AF request. The QoS modification to the QoS Flow associated with
the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows is done based on operator
policy and regulatory rules by means of local PCF configuration.

NOTE 3: According to regional/national regulatory requirements and
operator policy, On-Demand MPS (including MPS for Data Transport
Service) Service Users can be assigned the highest priority.

NOTE 4: If no configuration is provided, MPS for Data Transport Service
applies only to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.

NOTE 5: MPS for DTS controls the priority of traffic on QoS Flows
independent of the application(s) being used. Other mechanisms (e.g.
Priority PDU connectivity service) can be used to control the priority
of traffic on other QoS Flows under the control of specific data
application(s), based on operator policy.

NOTE 6: MPS for Data Transport Service can be applied to any DNN other
than the well-known DNN for IMS.

For MPS for Data Transport Service, the AF may also create an SDF for
priority signalling between the UE and the AF (see clause 6.1.3.11 of
TS 23.503 \[45\]).

Priority treatment is applicable to IMS based multimedia services and
Priority PDU connectivity service including MPS for Data Transport
Service.

Priority treatment for MPS includes priority message handling, including
priority treatment during authentication, security, and Mobility
Management procedures.

Priority treatment for MPS session requires appropriate ARP and 5QI
(plus 5G QoS characteristics) setting for QoS Flows according to the
operator\'s policy.

NOTE 7: Use of QoS Flows for MPS with QoS characteristics signalled as
part of QoS profile enables the flexible assignment of 5G QoS
characteristics (e.g. Priority Level) for MPS.

When an MPS session is requested by a Service User, the following
principles apply in the network:

\- QoS Flows employed in an MPS session shall be assigned ARP value
settings appropriate for the priority of the Service User.

\- Setting ARP pre-emption capability and vulnerability for MPS QoS
Flows, subject to operator policies and depending on national/regional
regulatory requirements.

\- Pre-emption of non-Service Users over Service Users during network
congestion situation, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations.

The terminating network identifies the priority of the MPS session and
applies priority treatment, including paging with priority, to ensure
that the MPS session can be established with priority to the terminating
user (either a Service User or normal user).

MPS priority mechanisms can be classified as subscription-related,
invocation-related, and those applied to existing QoS Flows.
Subscription related mechanisms, as described in clause 5.22.2, are
further divided into two groups: those which are always applied and
those which are conditionally applied. Invocation-related mechanisms, as
described in clause 5.22.3, are further divided into three groups: those
that apply for mobile originated SIP call/sessions, those that apply for
mobile terminated SIP call/sessions, and those that apply for the
Priority PDU connectivity services including MPS for Data Transport
Service. Methods applied to existing QoS Flows focus on handover and
congestion control and are described in clause 5.22.4.

NOTE 8: The network can hide its topology from the AF supporting MPS for
Data Transport Service. At the same time, the UE needs to provide its
locally known IP address to the AF supporting MPS for Data Transport
Service to support interactions with the applicable PCF. Thus, there can
be no NAT of the UE IP address between the UPF and the AF supporting MPS
for Data Transport Service.

### 5.16.6 Mission Critical Services

According to TS 22.280 \[37\], a Mission Critical Service (MCX Service)
is a communication service reflecting enabling capabilities Mission
Critical Applications and provided to end users from Mission Critical
Organizations and mission critical applications for other businesses and
organizations (e.g. utilities, railways). An MCX Service is either
Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) as defined in TS 23.379 \[38\],
Mission Critical Video (MCVideo) as defined in TS 23.281 \[39\], or
Mission Critical Data (MCData) as defined in TS 23.282 \[40\] and
represents a shared underlying set of requirements between two or more
MCX Service types. MCX Services are not restricted only to the ones
defined in this clause and such services can also have priority
treatment, if defined via operator\'s policy and/or local regulation.

MCX Services are based on the ability to invoke, modify, maintain and
release sessions with priority, and deliver the priority media packets
under network congestion conditions. As specified in clause 6.8 of
TS 22.261 \[2\], MCX Users require 5GS functionality that allows for
real-time, dynamic, secure and limited interaction with the QoS and
policy framework for modification of the QoS and policy framework by
authorized users. The limited interaction is based on operator policy,
and provides specific limitations on what aspects of the QoS and policy
framework an authorized MCX User can modify. MCX Services are supported
in a roaming environment when roaming agreements are in place and where
regulatory requirements apply.

An MCX-subscribed UE obtains priority access to the Radio Access Network
by using the Unified Access Control mechanism according to
TS 22.261 \[2\]. This mechanism provides preferential access to UEs
based on its assigned Access Identity. If an MCX-subscribed UE belongs
to the special Access Identity as defined in TS 22.261 \[2\], the UE has
preferential access to the network compared to ordinary UEs in periods
of congestion. MCX subscription allows users to receive priority
services, if the network supports MCX. MCX subscription entitles a USIM
with special Access Identity.

MCX Services leverage the foundation of the 5G QoS Model as defined in
clause 5.7, and 5G Policy Control as defined in clause 5.14. It requires
that the necessary subscriptions are in place for both the 5G QoS
Profile and the necessary Policies. In addition, MCX Services leverage
priority mechanism as defined in clause 5.22.

The terminating network identifies the priority of the MCX Service
session and applies priority treatment, including paging with priority,
to ensure that the MCX Service session can be established with priority
to the terminating user (either an MCX User or normal user).

Priority treatment for MCX Service includes priority message handling,
including priority treatment during authentication, security, and
Mobility Management procedures.

Priority treatment for MCX Service sessions require appropriate ARP and
5QI (plus 5G QoS characteristics) setting for QoS Flows according to the
operator\'s policy.

NOTE: Use of QoS Flows for MCX Service sessions with non-standardized
5QI values enables the flexible assignment of 5G QoS characteristics
(e.g. Priority Level).

When a MCX Service session is requested by an MCX User, the following
principles apply in the network:

\- QoS Flows employed in a MCX Service session shall be assigned ARP
value settings appropriate for the priority of the MCX User.

\- Setting ARP pre-emption capability and vulnerability of QoS Flows
related to a MCX Service session, subject to operator policies and
depending on national/regional regulatory requirements.

\- Pre-emption of non-MCX Users over MCX Users during network congestion
situations, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations.

Priority treatment is applicable to IMS based multimedia services and
priority PDU connectivity services.

Relative PDU priority decisions for MCX Service sessions are based on
real-time data of the state of the network and/or based on modification
of the QoS and policy framework by authorized users as described in
clause 6.8 of TS 22.261 \[2\].

## 5.17 Interworking and Migration

### 5.17.1 Support for Migration from EPC to 5GC

#### 5.17.1.1 General

Clause 5.17.1 describes the UE and network behaviour for the migration
from EPC to 5GC.

Deployments based on different 3GPP architecture options (i.e. EPC based
or 5GC based) and UEs with different capabilities (EPC NAS and 5GC NAS)
may coexist at the same time within one PLMN.

It is assumed that a UE that is capable of supporting 5GC NAS procedures
may also be capable of supporting EPC NAS (i.e. the NAS procedures
defined in TS 24.301 \[13\]) to operate in legacy networks e.g. in the
case of roaming.

The UE will use EPC NAS or 5GC NAS procedures depending on the core
network by which it is served.

In order to support smooth migration, it is assumed that the EPC and the
5GC have access to a common subscriber database, that is HSS in the case
of EPC and the UDM in the case of 5GC, acting as the master data base
for a given user as defined in TS 23.002 \[21\]. The PCF has access to
the UDR that acts as a common subscriber database for a given user
identified by a SUPI using the Nudr services defined in TS 23.502 \[3\].

![](media/image65.emf)

Figure 5.17.1.1-1: Architecture for migration scenario for EPC and 5G CN

A UE that supports only EPC based Dual Connectivity with secondary RAT
NR:

\- always performs initial access through E-UTRA (LTE-Uu) but never
through NR;

\- performs EPC NAS procedures over E-UTRA (i.e. Mobility Management,
Session Management etc) as defined in TS 24.301 \[13\].

A UE that supports camping on 5G Systems with 5GC NAS:

\- performs initial access either through E-UTRAN that connects to 5GC
or NR towards 5GC;

\- performs initial access through E-UTRAN towards EPC, if supported and
needed;

\- performs EPC NAS or 5GC NAS procedures over E-UTRAN or NR
respectively (i.e. Mobility Management, Session Management etc)
depending on whether the UE requests 5GC access or EPC access, if the UE
also supports EPC NAS.

When camping on an E-UTRA cell connected to both EPC and 5GC, a UE
supporting EPC NAS and 5GC NAS shall select a core network type (EPC or
5GC) and initiate the corresponding NAS procedure as specified in
TS 23.122 \[17\].

In order to support different UEs with different capabilities in the
same network, i.e. both UEs that are capable of only EPC NAS (possibly
including EPC based Dual Connectivity with secondary NR) and UEs that
support 5GC NAS procedures in the same network:

\- eNB that supports access to 5GC shall broadcast that it can connect
to 5GC. Based on that, the UE AS layer indicates \"E-UTRA connected to
5GC\" capability to the UE NAS layer. In addition the eNB broadcasts the
supported CIoT 5GS Optimisations that the UE uses for selecting a core
network type.

\- It is also expected that the UE AS layer is made aware by the UE NAS
layer whether a NAS signalling connection is to be initiated to the 5GC.
Based on that, UE AS layer indicates to the RAN whether it is requesting
5GC access (i.e. \"5GC requested\" indication). The RAN uses this
indication to determine whether a UE is requesting 5GC access or an EPC
access. RAN routes NAS signalling to the applicable AMF or MME
accordingly.

NOTE: The UE that supports EPC based Dual Connectivity with secondary
RAT only does not provide this \"5GC requested\" indication at Access
Stratum when it performs initial access and therefore eNB uses the
\"default\" CN selection mechanism to direct this UE to an MME

The 5GC network may steer the UE from 5GC based on:

\- Core Network type restriction (e.g. due to lack of roaming
agreements) described in clause 5.3.4.1.1;

\- Availability of EPC connectivity;

\- UE indication of EPC Preferred Network Behaviour; and

\- Supported Network Behaviour.

The UE that wants to use one or more of these functionalities not
supported by 5G System, when in CM-IDLE may disable all the related
radio capabilities that allow the UE to access 5G System. The triggers
to disable and re-enable the 5GS capabilities to access 5G System in
this case are left up to UE implementation.

#### 5.17.1.2 User Plane management to support interworking with EPS

In order to support the interworking with EPC, the SMF+PGW-C provides
information over N4 to the UPF+PGW-U related to the handling of traffic
over S5-U. Functionality defined in TS 23.503 \[45\] for traffic
steering control on SGi-LAN/N6 can be activated in UPF+PGW-U under
consideration of whether the UE is connected to EPC or 5GC.

When the UE is connected to EPC and establishes/releases PDN
connections, the following differences apply to N4 compared to when the
UE is connected to 5GC:

\- The CN Tunnel Info is allocated for each EPS Bearer.

\- In addition to the Service Data Flow related information, the
SMF+PGW-C shall be able to provide the GBR and MBR values for each GBR
bearer of the PDN connection to the UPF+PGW-U.

If the UE does not have preconfigured rules for associating an
application to a PDN connection (i.e. the UE does not have rules in UE
local configuration and is not provisioned with ANDSF rules), the UE
should use a matching URSP rule as defined in TS 23.503 \[45\], if
available, to derive the parameters, e.g. APN, for the PDN connection
establishment and associating an application to the PDN connection.

NOTE: The mapping between the parameters in the URSP rules and the
parameters used for PDN connection establishment is defined in
TS 24.526 \[110\].

#### 5.17.1.3 QoS handling for home routed roaming

During mobility from EPS to 5GS, the handling of QoS constraints in
V-SMF is specified in clauses 4.11.1.2.2 and 4.11.1.3.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] and follows the same principle as described in
clause 5.7.1.11.

### 5.17.2 Interworking with EPC

#### 5.17.2.1 General

Interworking with EPC in this clause refers to mobility procedures
between 5GC and EPC/E-UTRAN, except for clause 5.17.2.4. Network slicing
aspects for EPS Interworking are specified in clause 5.15.7

In order to interwork with EPC, the UE that supports both 5GC and EPC
NAS can operate in single-registration mode or dual-registration mode:

\- In single-registration mode, UE has only one active MM state (either
RM state in 5GC or EMM state in EPC) and it is either in 5GC NAS mode or
in EPC NAS mode (when connected to 5GC or EPC, respectively). UE
maintains a single coordinated registration for 5GC and EPC.
Accordingly, the UE maps the EPS-GUTI to 5G GUTI during mobility between
EPC and 5GC and vice versa following the mapping rules in Annex B. To
enable re-use of a previously established 5G security context when
returning to 5GC, the UE also keeps the native 5G-GUTI and the native 5G
security context when moving from 5GC to EPC.

\- In dual-registration mode, UE handles independent registrations for
5GC and EPC using separate RRC connections. In this mode, UE maintains
5G-GUTI and EPS-GUTI independently. In this mode, UE provides native
5G-GUTI, if previously allocated by 5GC, for registrations towards 5GC
and it provides native EPS-GUTI, if previously allocated by EPC, for
Attach/TAU towards EPC. In this mode, the UE may be registered to 5GC
only, EPC only, or to both 5GC and EPC.

Dual-registration mode is intended for interworking between EPS/E-UTRAN
and 5GS/NR. A dual-registered UE should not send its E-UTRA connected to
5GC and E-UTRAN radio capabilities to NR access when connected to 5GS/NR
to avoid being handed over to 5GC-connected E-UTRA or to E-UTRAN.

NOTE 1: This is to prevent the dual registered UE from being connected
to the same E-UTRA cell either connected to EPC or 5GC simultaneously
using separate RRC connections via single RAN node as a result of
handover. If a dual- registered UE implementation chooses to send its
E-UTRA capability when connected to 5GS/NR, the UE and the network
behaviour when UE enters a 5GC-connected E-UTRA is not further
specified. If however the UE is registered with 5GS/NR only, the UE can
send its E-UTRA capability in order to allow inter-RAT handover to
E-UTRA/5GC and Dual Connectivity with multiple RATs.

If a dual-registered UE had not sent its E-UTRA connected to 5GC and
E-UTRAN radio capabilities to 5GS and the UE needs to initiate emergency
services, it shall locally re-enable its E-UTRA connected to 5GC and
E-UTRAN radio capabilities in order to perform domain selection for
emergency services as defined in TS 23.167 \[18\].

NOTE 2: However even in this case, the UE is still not expected to
connect to E-UTRAN/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC simultaneously using separate RRC
connection via single RAN node as a result of the domain selection for
emergency services.

The support of single registration mode is mandatory for UEs that
support both 5GC and EPC NAS.

During E-UTRAN Initial Attach, UE supporting both 5GC and EPC NAS shall
indicate its support of 5G NAS in UE Network Capability described in
clause 4.11.1.5.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

During registration to 5GC, UE supporting both 5GC and EPC NAS shall
indicate its support of EPC NAS.

NOTE 3: This indication may be used to give the priority towards
selection of SMF+PGW-C for UEs that support both EPC and 5GC NAS.

If the UE supports 5GC NAS, at PDN connection establishment in EPC, the
UE may allocate a PDU Session ID and sends it via PCO, regardless of N1
mode status (i.e. enabled or disabled) in the UE.

NOTE 4: UE providing a PDU Session ID at PDN connection establishment
even when N1 mode is disabled allows for IP address preservation during
EPC to 5GC mobility once the UE re-enables N1 mode.

NOTE 5: For the case the MME has selected a standalone PGW for a PDN
connection, if the UE re-enables N1 mode and reports the change in UE
Network Capability, the MME can initiate PDN disconnection with
reactivation required as described in clause 4.11.0a.8 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] to allow selection of SMF+PGW-C thus session continuity
at EPC to 5GC mobility.

If the EPC supports \"Ethernet\" PDU Session Type, and the 5GSM
Capabilities indicate that the UE supports Ethernet PDN type in EPC,
then PDU Session type \"Ethernet\" is transferred to EPC as
\"Ethernet\". Otherwise, PDU Session types \"Ethernet\" and
\"Unstructured\" are transferred to EPC as \"non-IP\" PDN type (when
supported by UE and network). If the UE or EPC does not support Ethernet
PDN type in EPC, the UE sets the PDN type to non-IP when it moves from
5GS to EPS and after the transfer to EPS, and the UE and the SMF shall
maintain information about the PDU Session type used in 5GS, i.e.
information indicating that the PDN Connection with \"non-IP\" PDN type
corresponds to PDU Session type Ethernet or Unstructured respectively.
This is done to ensure that the appropriate PDU Session type will be
used if the UE transfers to 5GS.

PDN type \"non-IP\" is transferred to 5GS as \"Unstructured\" PDU
Session type if it is successfully transferred.

It is assumed that if a UE supports Ethernet PDU Session type and/or
Unstructured PDU Session type in 5GS it will also support non-IP PDN
type in EPS. If this is not the case, the UE shall locally delete any
EBI(s) corresponding to the Ethernet/Unstructured PDU Session(s) to
avoid that the Ethernet/Unstructured PDU Session(s) are transferred to
EPS.

MTU size consideration for PDU Sessions and PDN Connections towards a
SMF+PGW-C follows the requirements in clause 5.6.10.4.

Networks that support interworking with EPC, may support interworking
procedures that use the N26 interface or interworking procedures that do
not use the N26 interface. Interworking procedures with N26 support
provides IP address continuity on inter-system mobility to UEs that
support 5GC NAS and EPC NAS and that operate in single registration
mode. Networks that support interworking procedures without N26 shall
support procedures to provide IP address continuity on inter-system
mobility to UEs operating in both single-registration mode and
dual-registration mode. In such networks, AMF shall provide the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported to UEs during
initial Registration in 5GC or MME may optionally provide the indication
that interworking without N26 is supported in the Attach procedure in
EPC as defined in TS 23.401 \[26\].

If the network does not support interworking with EPC, network shall not
indicate support for \"interworking without N26\" to the UE.

When the HSS+UDM is required to provide the subscription data to the
MME, for each APN, only one SMF+PGW-C FQDN and associated APN is
provided to the MME according to TS 23.401 \[26\].

For interworking without N26 interface:

\- if the PDU session supports interworking, the SMF+PGW-C stores the
SMF+PGW-C FQDN to SMF context in HSS+UDM when the SMF is registered to
HSS+UDM.

\- For an APN, the HSS+UDM selects one of the stored SMF+PGW-C FQDN
based on operator\'s policy.

For interworking with N26 interface:

\- For a DNN, AMF determines PDU session(s) associated with 3GPP access
in only one SMF+PGW-C supporting EPS interworking via EBI allocation
procedure as described in clause 4.11.1.4.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- If the network supports EPS interworking of non-3GPP access connected
to 5GC, the AMF serving 3GPP access notifies the UDM to store the
association between DNN and SMF+PGW-C FQDN which supports EPS
interworking as Intersystem continuity context, to avoid MME receiving
inconsistent SMF+PGW-C FQDN from AMF and HSS+UDM.

\- The AMF updates Intersystem continuity context if the SMF+PGW-C and
DNN association is changed due to the AMF selecting another SMF+PGW-C
for EPS interworking for the same DNN.

\- If the SMF+PGW-C FQDN and associated DNN exists in Intersystem
continuity context, the HSS+UDM provides MME with SMF+PGW-C FQDN and
associated APN.

It does not assume that the HSS+UDM is aware of whether N26 is deployed
in the serving network. The HSS+UDM check the Intersystem continuity
context first. If no SMF+PGW-C FQDN associated with an DNN exists in
Intersystem continuity context, the HSS+UDM selects one of the SMF+PGW-C
FQDN for the APN from SMF context based on operator\'s policy.

In entire clause 5.17.2 the terms \"initial attach\", \"handover
attach\" and \"TAU\" for the UE procedures in EPC can alternatively be
combined EPS/IMSI Attach and combined TA/LA depending on the UE
configuration defined in TS 23.221 \[23\].

If a UE in MICO mode moves to E-UTRAN connected to EPC and any of the
triggers defined in clause 5.4.1.3 occur, then the UE shall locally
disable MICO mode and perform the TAU or Attach procedure as defined in
clause 5.17.2. The UE can renegotiate MICO when it returns to 5GS during
(re-)registration procedure.

IP address preservation for IP PDU sessions cannot be ensured on
subsequent mobility from EPC/E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN to a UE that had
initially registered in 5GS and moved to EPC/E-UTRAN.

NOTE 6: The SMF+PGW-C might not include the GERAN/UTRAN PDP Context
anchor functionality. Also, 5GC does not provide GERAN/UTRAN PDP Context
parameters to the UE when QoS Flows of PDU Session are setup or modified
in 5GS. Hence, the UE might not be able to activate the PDP contexts
when it transitions to GERAN/UTRAN.

IP address preservation for IP PDU sessions cannot be ensured on
subsequent mobility from EPC/E-UTRAN to 5GS for a 5GS NAS capable UE
that had initially established a PDP context via GERAN/UTRAN and moved
to EPC/E-UTRAN. IP address preservation for IP PDU session mobility
between EPC/E-UTRAN and 5GS may be re-ensured as specified in
clause 5.17.2.4 when UE moves from GERAN/UTRAN into EPC/E-UTRAN.

NOTE 7: The PGW acting as a GGSN might not support SMF+PGW-C
functionality. GPRS does not support 5GS parameters transfer between UE
and SMF+PGW-C (e.g. providing of PDU session ID and 5GS QoS
information).

When a PDU session is moved from 5GS to EPS, the SMF+PGW-C keeps the
registration and subscription in HSS+UDM until the corresponding PDN
connection is released.

The SMF+PGW-C receives notification of subscription update regarding the
5G parameters (e.g. DNNs, S-NSSAIs) which are associated with the
established PDN connection(s) connecting via EPS. If the subscription
regarding DNN, QoS profile or PDN connection type associated with the
PDN connection is updated, then the MME receives the subscription update
and triggers corresponding actions according to TS 23.401 \[26\]. If the
SMF+PGW-C receives subscription updates (e.g. change of 5GS Subscribed
NSSAI) from the UDM the SMF+PGW-C triggers corresponding actions for the
PDN connection. This may include (depending on the modified parameter)
to:

\- update the UPF (e.g. for a change of Framed Route information); or

\- release the PDN connection with an appropriate cause (e.g. for change
of EPS/5GS interworking support, for subscription removal of S-NSSAI
associated with the PDN connection);

\- do nothing about changes to DNN and/or PDU Session type that are
handled by the MME.

If header compression is used for Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS
Optimisations and when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS or from 5GS to EPS,
the UE may initiate the PDU Session Modification Procedure or UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure to renegotiate the
header compression configuration and to establish the compression
context between the UE and MME/SMF, see TS 23.401 \[26\] and
TS 24.501 \[47\].

If the UE is moving from 5GS to EPS and the RAT type is also moving from
a \"broadband\" RAT (e.g. NR or WB-E-UTRA) to NB-IoT in EMM-IDLE state,
the UE should set the mapped EPS bearer context for which the EPS bearer
is a dedicated EPS bearer to state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE as for NB-IoT
UEs in EPS only support the default bearers. In addition, UE shall
locally deactivate the related bearers according to the maximum number
of supported UP resources and send the latest bearer context status in
the TAU Request.

If APN Rate Control is used when the UE moves from EPC to 5GC then the
P-GW/SCEF and UE store the current APN Rate Control Status for an APN.
If while connected to 5GC the last PDU Session to a DNN that is the same
as the APN identified in the APN Rate Control Status is released then
the APN Rate Control Status may be stored in the AMF in addition to the
Small Data Rate Control Status and the UE discards the APN Rate Control
Status. The APN Rate Control Status is stored in the AMF so it can be
provided to the MME during mobility to EPC and subsequently applied at
establishment of a new first PDN Connection to the same APN, if valid.
The APN Rate Control Status is provided to the UPF+PGW-U if a first new
PDU Session is established towards the DNN that is the same as the APN
identified in the APN Rate Control Status if the UE moves back to EPC,
taking into account its validity period.

The UE may be provided with initial APN Rate Control parameters by the
SMF when a first new PDU Session is established for a DNN and S-NSSAI
that supports interworking with EPS and the DNN matches an APN. The SMF
provides the APN Rate Control Status for the APN that matches the DNN,
if available at the SMF, otherwise the configured APN Rate Control
parameters for the APN that matches the DNN are provided as the
initially applied parameters. If the initially applied parameters differ
from the configured APN Rate Control parameters and the first APN Rate
Control validity period expires, the UE is updated with the configured
APN Rate Control parameters once the UE has moved to EPC.

NOTE 8: If the APN Rate Control Status is provided to a UPF+PGW-U it is
not used for Small Data Rate Control while the UE is connected to 5GC,
it is only used as the APN Rate Control Status if the UE moves to EPC.

NOTE 9: Encoding of APN and DNN specified in TS 23.003 \[19\] allows the
comparison of EPS APN and 5GS DNN.

If a Service Gap timer is running in the AMF when the UE moves from 5GC
to EPC, the AMF stops the running Service Gap timer. If the UE returns
to 5GC from EPC the AMF provides the Service Gap Time to the UE as
described in clause 5.31.16.

If a Service Gap timer is running in the MME when the UE moves from EPC
to 5GC, the MME stops the running Service Gap timer. If the UE returns
to E-UTRAN connected to EPC from 5GC the MME provides the Service Gap
Time to the UE as described in TS 23.401 \[26\].

If a Service Gap timer is running in the UE when the UE moves to from
5GC to EPC and if Service Gap Time is received from the MME, the UE
stores the received Service Gap Time for later use when the timer needs
to be started next time, and the Service Gap timer that was started
before the system change is kept running in the UE and applied for EPC.
If a Service Gap timer is running in the UE when the UE moves to 5GC and
if Service Gap Time is received from the AMF, the UE stores the received
Service Gap Time for later use when the timer needs to be started next
time, and the Service Gap timer that was started before the system
change is kept running in the UE and applied in 5GS.

For UE currently served by EPC, a SMF+PGW-C may support L2TP tunnelling
on N6, as described in clause 5.8.2.16.

#### 5.17.2.2 Interworking Procedures with N26 interface

##### 5.17.2.2.1 General

Interworking procedures using the N26 interface, enables the exchange of
MM and SM states between the source and target network. The N26
interface may be either intra-PLMN or inter-PLMN (e.g. to enable
inter-PLMN mobility). When interworking procedures with N26 is used, the
UE operates in single-registration mode. For the 3GPP access, the
network keeps only one valid MM state for the UE, either in the AMF or
MME. For the 3GPP access, either the AMF or the MME is registered in the
HSS+UDM.

The support for N26 interface between AMF in 5GC and MME in EPC is
required to enable seamless session continuity (e.g. for voice services)
for inter-system change.

The UE\'s subscription may include restriction for Core Network Type
(EPC) and RAT restriction for E-UTRA. If so, the UDM provides these
restrictions to the AMF. The AMF includes RAT and Core Network type
restrictions in the Handover Restriction List to the NR. The AMF and NR
use these restrictions to determine if mobility of the UE to EPS or
E-UTRA connected to EPS should be permitted. When the UE moves from 5GS
to EPS, the SMF determines which PDU Sessions can be relocated to the
target EPS, e.g. based on capability of the deployed EPS, operator
policies for which PDU Session, seamless session continuity should be
supported etc. The SMF can release the PDU Sessions that cannot be
transferred as part of the handover or Idle mode mobility. However,
whether the PDU Session is successfully moved to the target network is
determined by target EPS.

Similarly, the UE\'s subscription may include restriction for Core
Network Type (5GC) and RAT restriction for NR. If so, the HSS provides
these restrictions to the MME. The MME includes RAT and Core Network
type restrictions in the Handover Restriction List to the E-UTRAN. The
MME and E-UTRAN use these restrictions to determine if mobility of the
UE to 5GS or NR connected to 5GS should be permitted. If the SMF+PGW-C
receives the PDU session ID from UE via PCO and know 5GC is not
restricted for the PDN connection by user subscription, the SMF+PGW-C
sends the mapped QoS parameters to UE. When the UE moves from EPS to
5GS, for the case when the MME has selected SMF+PGW-C even for PDN
connections that cannot be relocated to the target 5GS, the SMF+PGW-C
determines which PDN Connections can be relocated to the target 5GS,
e.g. based on capability of the deployed 5GS, subscription and operator
policies for which PDN Connection, seamless session continuity should be
supported etc. The SMF+PGW-C and NG-RAN can reject the PDN Connections
that cannot be transferred as part of the handover or Idle mode
mobility.

For the case when the MME has selected standalone P-GW for a PDN
connection for which session continuity is not supported and the AMF
cannot retrieve the address of the corresponding SMF during EPS to 5GS
mobility, the AMF does not move the PDN connection to 5GS.

NOTE 1: When applying the AMF planned removal procedure or the procedure
to handle AMF failures (see clause 5.21.2) implementations are expected
to update the DNS configuration to enable MMEs to discover alternative
AMFs if the MME tries to retrieve a UE context from an AMF that has been
taken out of service or has failed. This addresses the scenario of UEs
performing 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility and presenting a mapped GUTI
pointing to an AMF that has been taken out of service or has failed.

In the case of mobility from 5GS to EPS, if the MME lacks certain
capability, e.g. MME not supporting 15 EPS bearers, the 5GC shall not
transfer the UE EPS bearers and/or EPS PDN connections that are not
supported by the EPC network. If the MME does not support 15 EPS
bearers, the AMF determines which EBIs cannot be transferred to EPS, and
retrieves the EPS bearer contexts from the SMF+PGW-C for the EBIs that
can be transferred to EPS.

NOTE 2: How the AMF determines which EBIs can be transferred to EPS is
according to local configuration, e.g. according to DNN, S-NSSAI, ARP
associated with an EBI.

##### 5.17.2.2.2 Mobility for UEs in single-registration mode

When the UE supports single-registration mode and network supports
interworking procedure with the N26 interface:

\- For idle mode mobility from 5GS to EPS, the UE performs either TAU or
Attach procedure with EPS GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI sent as old Native
GUTI, as described in clause 4.11.1.3.2.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\] and
indicates that it is moving from 5GC. The UE includes in the RRC message
a GUMMEI mapped from the 5G-GUTI and indicates it as a native GUMMEI and
should in addition indicate it as \"Mapped from 5G-GUTI\". The MME
retrieves the UE\'s MM and SM context from 5GC. For connected mode
mobility from 5GS to EPS, either inter-system handover or RRC Connection
Release with Redirection to E-UTRAN is performed. At inter-system
handover, the AMF selects target MME based on 2 octet TAC format used in
the Target ID as specified in TS 38.413 \[34\]. During the TAU or Attach
procedure the HSS+UDM cancels any AMF registration associated with the
3GPP access (but not AMF registration associated with the non-3GPP
access): an AMF that was serving the UE over both 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses does not consider the UE as deregistered over non 3GPP access.

\- For the first TAU after 5GC initial Registration, the UE and MME for
the handling of UE Radio Capabilities follow the procedures as defined
in clause 5.11.2 of TS 23.401 \[26\] for first TAU after GERAN/UTRAN
Attach.

NOTE 1: MMEs supporting interworking with N26 interface are not required
to process the indication from the UE that it is moving from 5GC and
will assume that the UE is moving from another MME.

\- For idle mode mobility from EPC to 5GC, the UE performs mobility
Registration procedure with the 5G GUTI mapped from EPS GUTI and
indicates that it is moving from EPC. The UE derives GUAMI from the
native 5G-GUTI and includes GUAMI in the RRC message to enable RAN to
route to the corresponding AMF (if available). If the UE holds no native
5G-GUTI, then the UE provides in the RRC message a GUAMI mapped from the
EPS GUTI and indicates it as \"Mapped from EPS\". The AMF and SMF
retrieve the UE\'s MM and SM context from EPC. For connected mode
mobility from EPC to 5GC, either inter-system handover or RRC Connection
Release with Redirection to NG-RAN is performed. At inter-system
handover, the MME selects target AMF based on TAC used in the Target ID
as specified in TS 38.413 \[34\]. During the Registration procedure, the
HSS+UDM cancels any MME registration.

NOTE 2: During a transition period, the source eNB may be configured via
O&M to know that the MME is not upgraded and thus supports only 2 octet
TAC. The Target ID for the NG-RAN node is set as \"Target eNB ID\" in
the existing IEs as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\].

For both idle mode and connected mode mobility from EPC to 5GC:

\- The UE includes the native 5G-GUTI as an additional GUTI in the
Registration request; the AMF uses the native 5G-GUTI to retrieve MM
context identified by the 5G-GUTI from old AMF or from UDSF (if UDSF is
deployed and the old AMF is within the same AMF set).

\- If this is the first mobility event for a PDU Session that was
established while being connected to EPC, the UE shall trigger the PDU
Session Modification procedure and:

\- should indicate the support of Reflective QoS to the network (i.e.
SMF) if the UE supports Reflective QoS functionality. If the UE
indicated support of Reflective QoS, the network may provide a
Reflective QoS Timer (RQ Timer) value to the UE;

\- shall indicate the number of supported packet filters for signalled
QoS rules, if the UE supports more than 16 packet filters for the PDU
Session. The network shall store this information so that subsequent
mobility events do not require another signalling of it.

\- should indicate the support of Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session to the
network (i.e. SMF) if the UE supports Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session. If
the UE indicated support of Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session, the network
shall consider that this PDU session is supported to use multiple IPv6
prefixes.

\- should provide the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate to the
network (i.e. SMF). The network shall consider that the maximum data
rate per UE for user-plane integrity protection supported by the UE is
valid for the lifetime of the PDU session.

#### 5.17.2.3 Interworking Procedures without N26 interface

##### 5.17.2.3.1 General

For interworking without the N26 interface, IP address preservation is
provided to the UEs on inter-system mobility by storing and fetching
SMF+PGW-C and corresponding APN/DNN information via the HSS+UDM. In such
networks AMF also provides an indication that interworking without N26
is supported to UEs during Initial Registration in 5GC or MME may
optionally provide an indication that interworking without N26 is
supported in the Attach procedure in EPC as defined in TS 23.502 \[3\]
and TS 23.401 \[26\]. The UE provides an indication that it supports
Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the
attach procedure as described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[26\] and
during initial Registration and Mobility Registration Update in 5GC.

NOTE 1: The UE support of Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN
connectivity request during the attach procedure is needed for IP
address preservation in the case of interworking without N26.

The indication that interworking without N26 is valid for the entire
Registered PLMN and for PLMNs equivalent to the Registered PLMN that are
available in the Registration Area. The same indication is provided to
all UEs served by the same PLMN. UEs that operate in interworking
without N26 may use this indication to decide whether to register early
in the target system. UEs that only support single registration mode may
use this indication as described in clause 5.17.2.3.2. UE that support
dual registration mode uses this indication as described in
clause 5.17.2.3.3.

Interworking procedures without N26 interface use the following two
features:

1\. When UE performs Initial Attach in EPC (with or without \"Handover\"
indication in PDN CONNECTIVITY Request message) and indicates that it is
moving from 5GC, the MME indicates to the HSS+UDM not to cancel the
registration of AMF, if any.

2\. When UE performs Initial Registration in 5GC and indicates that it
is moving from EPC, the AMF indicates to the HSS+UDM not to cancel the
registration of MME, if any.

To support mobility both for single and dual registration mode UEs, the
following also are supported by the network:

3\. When PDU Session are created in 5GC, the SMF+PGW-C which supports
EPS interworking stores the SMF+PGW-C FQDN along with DNN in the
HSS+UDM.

4\. The HSS+UDM provides the information about dynamically allocated
SMF+PGW-C and APN/DNN information to the target CN network. If there are
multiple SMF+PGW-C serving the UE for the same DNN which support EPS
interworking in 5GS, the HSS+UDM select one of them according to
operator\'s policy and provides together with the associated APN to the
MME.

5\. When PDN connections are created in EPC, the MME stores the
SMF+PGW-C and APN information in the HSS+UDM.

NOTE 2: Items 3, 4 and 5 are also supported in networks that support
interworking with N26 procedures. This enables a VPLMN that does not
deploy N26 interface to provide IP address preservation to roamed-in
single-registration mode UEs from a HPLMN that only supports
interworking with N26 procedures.

When the network serving the UE supports 5GS-EPS interworking procedures
without N26 interface, the SMF shall not provide the UEs with mapped
target system parameters of the target system when UE is in the source
network.

A UE that operates in dual registration mode ignores any received mapped
target system parameters (e.g. QoS parameters, bearer IDs/QFI, PDU
Session ID, etc.).

##### 5.17.2.3.2 Mobility for UEs in single-registration mode

When the UE supports single-registration mode and network supports
interworking procedure without N26 interface:

\- For mobility from 5GC to EPC, the UE with at least one PDU Session
established in 5GC may either:

\- if supported and if it has received the network indication that
interworking without N26 is supported, perform Attach in EPC with a
native EPS GUTI, if available, otherwise with IMSI with Request type
\"Handover\" in PDN CONNECTIVITY Request message (clause 5.3.2.1 of
TS 23.401 \[26\]) and indicating that the UE is moving from 5GC and
subsequently moves all its other PDU Session using the UE requested PDN
connectivity establishment procedure with Request Type \"handover\" flag
(clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 \[26\]), or.

\- perform TAU with 4G-GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI sent as old Native GUTI
(clause 5.3.3 of TS 23.401 \[26\]) indicating that it is moving from
5GC, in which case the MME instructs the UE to re-attach. IP address
preservation is not provided in this case.

\- for the first TAU after 5GC initial Registration, the UE and MME for
the handling of UE Radio Capabilities follow the procedures as defined
in clause 5.11.2 TS 23.401 \[26\] for first TAU after GERAN/UTRAN
Attach.

NOTE 1: The first PDN connection may be established during the E-UTRAN
Initial Attach procedure (see TS 23.401 \[26\]).

NOTE 2: At inter-PLMN mobility to a PLMN that is not an equivalent PLMN
the UE always uses the TAU procedure.

\- For mobility from 5GC to EPC, the UE with no PDU Session established
in 5GC

\- performs Attach in EPC (clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[26\])
indicating that the UE is moving from 5GC.

\- For mobility from EPC to 5GC, the UE performs Mobility Registration
Update in 5GC with 5G-GUTI mapped from EPS GUTI and a native 5G-GUTI, if
available, as Additional GUTI and indicating that the UE is moving from
EPC. In this case, the AMF determines that old node is an MME, but
proceeds as if the Registration is of type \"initial registration\". The
UE may either:

\- if supported and if it has received the network indication
\"interworking without N26 supported\", move all its PDN connections
from EPC using the UE initiated PDU Session Establishment procedure with
\"Existing PDU Sessions\" flag (clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), or

\- re-establish PDU Sessions corresponding to the PDN connections that
it had in EPS. IP address preservation is not provided in this case.

NOTE 3: The additional native 5G-GUTI enables the AMF to find the UE\'s
5G security context (if available).

NOTE 4: When single-registration mode UE uses interworking procedures
without N26, the registration states during the transition period (e.g.
while UE is transferring all PDU Sessions / PDN Connections on the
target side) are defined in Stage 3 specifications.

\- If the network determines that the UE is changing RAT type, if the UE
requests to relocate the PDU session from EPC to 5GC or 5GC to EPC, the
SMF/MME uses the \"PDU session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" or
\"PDN continuity at inter-RAT mobility\" information, respectively, in
the subscription to determine whether to maintain the PDU session/PDN
connection (if being handed over) or reject the PDU session request,
with the relevant cause.

\- If the UE requested to move the PDU session and the \"PDN continuity
at inter RAT mobility\" information indicated \"disconnect the PDN
connection with a reactivation request\" the network should provide a
suitable cause code to the UE so that it can request a new PDU session.

##### 5.17.2.3.3 Mobility for UEs in dual-registration mode

To support mobility in dual-registration mode, the support of N26
interface between AMF in 5GC and MME in EPC is not required. A UE that
supports dual registration mode may operate in this mode when it
receives an indication from the network that interworking without N26 is
supported.

For UE operating in dual-registration mode the following principles
apply for PDU Session transfer from 5GC to EPC:

\- UE operating in Dual Registration mode may register in EPC ahead of
any PDU Session transfer using the Attach procedure indicating that the
UE is moving from 5GC without establishing a PDN Connection in EPC if
the EPC supports EPS Attach without PDN Connectivity as defined in
TS 23.401 \[26\]. Support for EPS Attach without PDN Connectivity is
mandatory for UE supporting dual-registration procedures.

NOTE 1: Before attempting early registration in EPC the UE needs to
check whether EPC supports EPS Attach without PDN Connectivity by
reading the related SIB in the target cell.

\- UE performs PDU Session transfer from 5GC to EPC using the UE
initiated PDN connection establishment procedure with \"handover\"
indication in the PDN Connection Request message (clause 5.10.2 of
TS 23.401 \[26\]).

\- If the UE has not registered with EPC ahead of the PDU Session
transfer, the UE can perform Attach in EPC with \"handover\" indication
in the PDN Connection Request message (clause 5.3.2.1 of
TS 23.401 \[26\]).

\- UE may selectively transfer certain PDU Sessions to EPC, while
keeping other PDU Sessions in 5GC.

\- UE may maintain the registration up to date in both 5GC and EPC by
re-registering periodically in both systems. If the registration in
either 5GC or EPC times out (e.g. upon mobile reachable timer expiry),
the corresponding network starts an implicit detach timer.

NOTE 2: Whether UE transfers some or all PDU Sessions on the EPC side
and whether it maintains the registration up to date in both EPC and 5GC
can depend on UE capabilities that are implementation dependent. The
information for determining which PDU Sessions are transferred on EPC
side and the triggers can be pre-configured in the UE and are not
specified in this Release of the specification. The UE does not know
before-hand, i.e. before trying to move a given PDU session to EPC,
whether that PDU session can be transferred to EPC.

For UE operating in dual-registration mode the following principles
apply for PDN connection transfer from EPC to 5GC:

\- UE operating in Dual Registration mode may register in 5GC ahead of
any PDN connection transfer using the Registration procedure indicating
that the UE is moving from EPC (clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

\- UE performs PDN connection transfer from EPC to 5GC using the UE
initiated PDU Session Establishment procedure with \"Existing PDU
Session\" indication (clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

\- UE may selectively transfer certain PDN connections to 5GC, while
keeping other PDN Connections in EPC.

\- UE may maintain the registration up to date in both EPC and 5GC by
re-registering periodically in both systems. If the registration in
either EPC or 5GC times out (e.g. upon mobile reachable timer expiry),
the corresponding network starts an implicit detach timer.

NOTE 3: Whether UE transfers some or all PDN connections on the 5GC side
and whether it maintains the registration up to date in both 5GC and EPC
can depend on UE capabilities that are implementation dependent. The
information for determining which PDN connections are transferred on 5GC
side and the triggers can be pre-configured in the UE and are not
specified in this Release of the specification. The UE does not know
before-hand, i.e. before trying to move a given PDN connection to 5GC,
whether that PDN connection can be transferred to 5GC.

NOTE 4: If EPC does not support EPS Attach without PDN Connectivity the
MME detaches the UE when the last PDN connection is released by the PGW
as described in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 \[26\] (in relation to
transfer of the last PDN connection to non-3GPP access).

When sending a control plane request for MT services (e.g. MT SMS) the
network routes it via either the EPC or the 5GC. In absence of UE
response, the network should attempt routing the control plane request
via the other system.

NOTE 5: The choice of the system through which the network attempts to
deliver the control plane request first is left to network
configuration.

##### 5.17.2.3.4 Redirection for UEs in connected state

When the UE supports single-registration mode or dual-registration mode
without N26 interface:

\- If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in 5GC, the NG-RAN may perform RRC
Connection Release with Redirection to E-UTRAN based on certain criteria
(e.g. based on local configuration in NG-RAN, or triggered by the AMF
upon receiving Handover Request message from NG-RAN).

\- If the UE is in ECM-CONNECTED state in EPC, the E-UTRAN may perform
RRC Connection release with redirection to NG-RAN based on certain
criteria (e.g. based on local configuration in E-UTRAN, or triggered by
the MME upon receiving handover request from E-UTRAN).

#### 5.17.2.4 Mobility between 5GS and GERAN/UTRAN

IP address preservation upon direct mobility between 5GS and GERAN/UTRAN
is not supported.

Upon mobility from 5GS to GERAN/UTRAN (e.g. upon leaving NG-RAN
coverage) the UE shall perform the A/Gb mode GPRS Attach procedure or Iu
mode GPRS Attach procedure (see TS 23.060 \[56\]).

As a UE option, to support IP address preservation at mobility from EPC
to 5GS for PDN connections without 5GS related parameters, a 5GS capable
UE may:

\- Following mobility from GERAN/UTRAN to EPS, release those PDN
connection(s) and re-establish them as specified in clause 4.11.1.5.4.1
of TS 23.502 \[3\] so that they support interworking to 5GS.

NOTE 1: It is recommended that a UE using this option does not do this
behaviour after every change to EPS in PLMNs that do not support 5GS,
nor for APNs that do not support mobility to 5GS; and, that such a UE
supports storage of the 5GS related parameters while in GERAN/UTRAN.
Whether and how the UE is aware of which PLMNs support 5GS and which
APNs do not support mobility to 5GS is out of scope of this
specification.

To support mobility from EPC to 5GS to EPC to GERAN/UTRAN for PDN
connections established in EPC:

NOTE 2: For the use of N7 or N40 interfaces while the UE is in
GERAN/UTRAN access, the SMF+PGW-C selected by the MME (using the
existing selection procedures described in clause 4.11.0a of
TS 23.502 \[3\] and clause 4.3.8 of TS 23.401 \[26\]) needs to support
functionality (e.g. signalling of GERAN/UTRAN cell identification over
N7) specified in Annex L.

\- in signalling sent on the N26 interface, the MME should send the TI
and BSS Container in the EPS Bearer Context (see Table 7.3.1-3 of
TS 29.274 \[101\]), if there is any, of the EPS bearer to the SMF (V-SMF
/ I-SMF) via the AMF in the Bearer Context within the PDN Connection IE
in the Forward Relocation Request and Context Response messages
(TS 29.274 \[101\]); the SMF (V-SMF / I-SMF) should store the TI and BSS
Container and the SMF (V-SMF / I-SMF) should provide the TI and BSS
Container to the AMF (as part of a procedure to deliver SM context to
AMF) so that the AMF sends the TI and BSS Container of the related EPS
bearer in the Bearer Context within the EPS PDN Connection information
in any subsequent Forward Relocation Request and Context Response
message sent to an MME.

NOTE 3: At mobility from EPC, the SMF+PGW-C / V-SMF / I-SMF receives the
TI and BSS Container as part of the UE EPS PDN Connection information
from the AMF and stores the TI. At mobility to EPC, the SMF+PGW-C /
V-SMF / I-SMF provides the AMF with the TI and BSS Container as part of
the UE EPS PDN Connection information. The SMF+PGW-C / V-SMF / I-SMF is
not meant to understand the TI/BSS Container nor to use it for any other
purpose than providing it back to AMF.

NOTE 4: GERAN/UTRAN Mobility Management Bearer Synchronisation
procedures will release any dedicated QoS Flows established in 5GS.

NOTE 5: When the UE access the network via GERAN/UTRAN over Gn/Gp
interface, Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure is not supported.

IP address preservation at mobility from EPC to GERAN/UTRAN for PDU
sessions established in 5GS is not supported.

With regard to interworking between 5GS and the Circuit Switched domain
when the GERAN or UTRAN network is operating in NMO II (i.e. no Gs
interface between MSC and SGSN):

\- upon mobility from 5GS to GERAN/UTRAN, the UE shall either:

\- act as if it is returning after a loss of GERAN/UTRAN coverage (and
e.g. only perform a periodic LAU if the periodic LAU timer has expired),
or,

\- perform a Location Update to the MSC. If the UE is registered for IMS
voice and is configured, using Device Management or initial
provisioning, to perform additional mobility management procedures when
it has moved from a RAT that supports IMS voice over PS sessions to one
that does not (see TS 23.060 \[56\]), it shall follow this option.

Upon mobility from GERAN/UTRAN to 5GS (e.g. upon selecting an NG-RAN
cell) the UE shall perform the Registration procedure of \"initial
registration\" type as described in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The UE shall
indicate a 5G-GUTI as UE identity in the Registration procedure if it
has a stored valid native 5G-GUTI (e.g. from an earlier registration in
the 5G System). Otherwise the UE shall indicate a SUCI.

If a UE in MICO mode moves to GERAN/UTRAN and any of the triggers
defined in clause 5.4.1.3 occur, then the UE shall locally disable MICO
mode and perform the A/Gb mode GPRS Attach procedure or Iu mode GPRS
Attach procedure (see TS 23.060 \[56\]). The UE can renegotiate MICO
when it returns to 5GS during (re-)registration procedure.

In Single Registration mode, expiry of the periodic RAU timer, or, the
periodic LAU timer shall not cause the UE to change RAT.

The 5G SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN is specified in the TS 23.216 \[88\].
After the 5G SRVCC to UTRAN, all the PDU sessions of the UE are
released.

### 5.17.3 Interworking with EPC in presence of Non-3GPP PDU Sessions

When a UE is simultaneously connected to the 5GC over a 3GPP access and
a non-3GPP access, it may have PDU Sessions associated with 3GPP access
and PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP access. When inter-system
handover from 5GS to EPS is performed for PDU Sessions associated with
3GPP access, the PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP access are kept
anchored by the network in 5GC and the UE may either:

\- keep PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP access in 5GS (5GC+N3IWF
or TNGF) (i.e. the UE is then registered both in EPS and, for non-3GPP
access, in 5GS); or

\- locally or explicitly release PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP
access; or

\- once in EPS, transfer PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP access to
E-UTRAN by triggering PDN connection establishment with Request Type
\"Handover\", as specified in TS 23.401 \[26\].

### 5.17.4 Network sharing support and interworking between EPS and 5GS

The detailed description for supporting network sharing and interworking
between EPS and 5GS is described in clauses 4.11.1.2.1, 4.11.1.2.2,
4.11.1.3.2 and 4.11.1.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.17.5 Service Exposure in Interworking Scenarios

#### 5.17.5.1 General

Clause 4.3.5 shows the Service Exposure Network Architecture in
scenarios where for EPC-5GC Interworking is required.

In scenarios where interworking between 5GS and EPC is possible, the
network configuration is expected to associate UEs with SCEF+NEF node(s)
for Service Capability Exposure. The SCEF+NEF hides the underlying 3GPP
network topology from the AF (e.g. SCS/AS) and hides whether the UE is
served by 5GC or EPC.

If the service exposure function that is associated with a given service
for a UE is configured in the UE\'s subscription information, then an
SCEF+NEF identity shall be used to identify the exposure function. For
example, if a UE is capable of switching between EPC and 5GC, then the
SCEF ID that is associated with any of the UE\'s APN configurations
should point to an SCEF+NEF node.

For external exposure of services related to specific UE(s), the
SCEF+NEF resides in the HPLMN. Depending on operator agreements, the
SCEF+NEF in the HPLMN may have interface(s) with NF(s) in the VPLMN.

The SCEF+NEF exposes over N33 the same API as the SCEF supports over T8.
If CAPIF is not supported, the AF is locally configured with the API
termination points for each service. If CAPIF is supported, the AF
obtains the service API information from the CAPIF core function via the
Availability of service APIs event notification or Service Discover
Response as specified in TS 23.222 \[64\].

The common state information shall be maintained by the combined
SCEF+NEF node in order to meet the external interface requirements of
the combined node. The common state information includes at least the
following data that needs to be common for the SCEF and NEF roles of
SCEF+NEF:

\- SCEF+NEF ID (must be the same towards the AF).

\- SCEF+NEF common IP address and port number.

\- Monitoring state for any ongoing monitoring request.

\- Configured set of APIs supported by SCEF+ NEF.

\- PDN Connection/PDU Session State and NIDD Configuration Information,
including Reliable Data Service state information.

\- Network Parameter Configuration Information (e.g. Maximum Response
Time and Maximum Latency).

The SCEF+NEF need not perform the same procedures for the configuration
of monitoring events towards the HSS+UDM twice. For example, if the
HSS+UDM is deployed as a combined node, a monitoring event only need to
be configured by the SCEF+NEF just once.

The SCEF+NEF may configure monitoring events applicable to both EPC and
5GC using only 5GC procedures towards UDM. In this case, the SCEF+NEF
shall indicate that the monitoring event is also applicable to EPC (i.e.
the event must be reported both by 5GC and EPC) and may include a SCEF
address (i.e. if the event needs to be configured in a serving node in
the EPC and the corresponding notification needs to be sent directly to
the SCEF). If the HSS and UDM are deployed as separate network entities,
UDM shall use HSS services to configure the monitoring event in EPC as
defined in TS 23.632 \[102\]. The UDM shall return an indication to
SCEF+NEF of whether the configuration of the monitoring event in EPC was
successful. In the case that the UDM reports that the configuration of a
monitoring event was not possible in EPC, then the SCEF+NEF may
configure the monitoring event using EPC procedures via the HSS as
defined in TS 23.682 \[36\].

NOTE 1: The SCEF+NEF uses only 5GC procedures to configure monitoring
events in EPC and 5GC.

NOTE 2: In terms of the CAPIF, the SCEF+NEF is considered a single node.

#### 5.17.5.2 Support of interworking for Monitoring Events

##### 5.17.5.2.1 Interworking with N26 interface

In addition to the interworking principles documented in
clause 5.17.2.2, the following applies for interworking with N26:

\- When UE moves from EPS to 5GS, when the AMF registers in UDM, if no
event subscription via UDM is available, the AMF indicates the situation
to the UDM, and in this case the UDM can decide if the event
subscriptions should be provisioned, otherwise if the AMF has event
subscription information, after the registration procedure is completed,
the AMF may inform the UDM of the currently subscribed events, and UDM
will do synchronization if needed.

\- When UE moves from 5GS to EPS, the MME gets monitoring event
configuration from HSS during as part of mobility procedure as specified
in clause 4.11.1.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

##### 5.17.5.2.2 Interworking without N26 interface

In addition to the interworking principles documented in
clause 5.17.2.3, the additional behaviour at EPS to 5GS mobility in
clause 5.17.5.2.1 also applies.

When SCEF+NEF performs the procedure of monitoring via the AMF as
described in clause 4.15.3.2.4 (\"Exposure with bulk subscription\") in
TS 23.502 \[3\], if the AMF determines the interworking without N26
interface is supported, the AMF shall subscribe MME ID in the case of
UE\'s mobility from 5GS to EPS from UDM+HSS on behalf of SCEF+NEF as
described in clause 7.1.2. For single-registration mode, when UE\'s
mobility from 5GS to EPS happens and Serving MME sends Update Location
Request to the UDM+HSS, the UDM+HSS provides Serving MME ID to the
SCEF+NEF which is the notification endpoint based on the subscription
request from AMF. Then the SCEF+NEF performs the procedure of
configuring monitoring via the MME for the same Monitoring Events as
described in clause 5.6.2.1 of TS 23.682 \[36\].

When SCEF+NEF performs the procedure of monitoring via the UDM+HSS as
described in clause 4.15.3.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\], when UE\'s mobility
between 5GS and EPS happens, the UDM+HSS performs the procedure of
configuring monitoring at the MME as described in clause 5.6.1.1 of
TS 23.682 \[36\] and at the AMF as described in clause 4.15.3.2.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 5.17.5.3 Availability or expected level of a service API

A service related with common north-bound API may become unavailable due
to UE being served by a CN node not supporting the service. If the
availability or expected level of support of a service API associated
with a UE changes, for example due to a mobility between 5GC and EPC,
the AF shall be made aware of the change.

NOTE 1: If CAPIF is supported and the service APIs become (un)available
for the 5GC or EPC network, the AF obtains such information from the
CAPIF core function.

If the SCEF+NEF receives the subscription request from the AF for the
availability or expected level of support of a service API, the SCEF+NEF
subscribes a CN Type Change event for the UE or Group of UEs to the
HSS+UDM. If the HSS+UDM receives the subscription for CN Type Change
event, the HSS+UDM includes the latest CN type for the UE or Group of
UEs in the response for the subscription. If the HSS+UDM detects that
the UE switches between being served by the MME and the AMF, the CN Type
Change event is triggered, and the HSS+UDM notifies the latest CN type
for the UE or Group of UEs to the SCEF+NEF. Based on the CN type
information, the SCEF+NEF can determine the availability or expected
level of support of a given service. The AF will be informed of such
information via a subscription/notification service operation. The AF
can subscribe for the availability or expected level of support of a
service API with report type indicating either One-time report or
Continuous report. If there is no CN type information for the UE in the
SCEF+NEF, the SCEF+NEF subscribes monitoring event for a new CN Type
Change event for the UE or Group of UEs to the HSS+UDM, otherwise,
SCEF+NEF determines the CN type locally in the following conditions:

\- If the AF subscribes with report type indicating One-time report, the
SCEF+NEF may consider the Freshness Timer of the latest CN type
information for the UE or Group of UEs. The Freshness Timer is a
parameter that is configured based on local SCEF+NEF policy. When a
subscription request with One-time report type is received the SCEF+NEF
checks if there is the latest CN type information received from the
HSS+UDM for the indicated UE ID or External Group ID. If the elapsed
time for the CN type information since the last reception is less than
the Freshness Timer, then the SCEF+NEF may respond to the AF with the
latest CN type information in order to avoid repeated query to HSS+UDM.

\- The SCEF+NEF has established a direct connection with MME or AMF or
SMF.

When the UE or all members of a Group of UEs are being served by a MME,
EPC is determined as CN type. When the UE or all members of a Group of
UEs are being served by an AMF, 5GC is determined as CN type. When the
UE is registered both in EPC and 5GC, or some members of a Group of UEs
are registered in EPC while some members are registered in 5GC, 5GC+EPC
is determined as CN type.

NOTE 2: If 5GC+EPC is determined as the CN type serving the UE or the
group of UEs, the SCEF+NEF determines that service APIs for both 5GC and
EPC are available to the UE or the group of UEs.

### 5.17.6 Void

### 5.17.7 Configuration Transfer Procedure between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN

#### 5.17.7.1 Architecture Principles for Configuration Transfer between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN

The purpose of the Configuration Transfer between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN is
to enable the transfer the RAN configuration information between the gNB
and eNodeB via MME and AMF.

In order to make the information transparent for the MME and AMF, the
information is included in a transparent container. The source and
target RAN node addresses, which allows the Core Network nodes to route
the messages. The mechanism depicted in Figure 5.17.7.1-1.

![](media/image66.emf)

Figure 5.17.7.1-1: Configuration Transfer between gNB and E-UTRAN basic
network architecture

The NG-RAN transparent containers are transferred from the source NG-RAN
node to the destination E-UTRAN node and vice versa by use of
Configuration Transfer messages.

An ENB Configuration Transfer message is used from the E-UTRAN node to
the MME over S1 interface as described in TS 36.413 \[100\], the
destination RAN node includes the en-gNB Identifier and may include a
TAI associated with the en-gNB. If MME is aware that the en-gNB serves
cells which provide access to 5GC, the MME relays the request towards a
suitable AMF via inter-system signalling based on a broadcast 5G TAC. An
AMF Configuration Transfer message is used from the AMF to the NG-RAN
over N2 interface.

A Configuration Transfer message is used by the gNB node to the AMF over
N2 interface for the reply, and a Configuration Transfer Tunnel message
is used to tunnel the transparent container from AMF to MME over the N26
interface. MME relays this reply to the target eNB using a MME
CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message. Transport of the RAN containers in
E-UTRAN is specified in TS 23.401 \[26\].

Each Configuration Transfer message carrying the transparent container
is routed and relayed independently by the core network node(s). Any
relation between messages is transparent for the AMF and MME, i.e. a
request/response exchange between applications, for example SON
applications, is routed and relayed as two independent messages by the
AMF and MME.

#### 5.17.7.2 Addressing, routing and relaying

##### 5.17.7.2.1 Addressing

All the Configuration Transfer messages contain the addresses of the
source and destination RAN nodes.

An gNB node is addressed by the Target NG-RAN node identifier as
described in TS 38.413 \[34\].

An eNodeB is addressed by the Target eNodeB identifier as described in
TS 36.413 \[100\].

##### 5.17.7.2.2 Routing

The source RAN node sends a message to its core network node including
the source and destination addresses.

MME uses the destination address to route the message to the correct AMF
via N26 interface. AMF uses the destination address to route the message
to the correct MME via N26 interface.

The AMF connected to the destination RAN node decides which RAN node to
send the message to, based on the destination address.

The MME connected to the destination RAN node decides which RAN node to
send the message to, based on the destination address.

##### 5.17.7.2.3 Relaying

The AMF performs relaying between N2 and N26 messages as described in
TS 38.413 \[34\] and TS 29.274 \[101\].

The MME performs relaying between S1 and N26 message as described in
TS 36.413 \[100\] and TS 29.274 \[101\].

## 5.18 Network Sharing

### 5.18.1 General concepts

A network sharing architecture shall allow multiple participating
operators to share resources of a single shared network according to
agreed allocation schemes. The shared network includes a radio access
network. The shared resources include radio resources.

The shared network operator allocates shared resources to the
participating operators based on their planned and current needs and
according to service level agreements.

In this Release of the specification, only the 5G Multi-Operator Core
Network (5G MOCN) network sharing architecture, in which only the RAN is
shared in 5G System, is supported. 5G MOCN for 5G System, including UE,
RAN and AMF, shall support operators\' ability to use more than one PLMN
ID (i.e. with same or different country code (MCC) some of which is
specified in TS 23.122 \[17\] and different network codes (MNC)) or
combinations of PLMN ID and NID. 5G MOCN supports NG-RAN Sharing with or
without multiple Cell Identity broadcast as described in
TS 38.300 \[27\].

5G MOCN also supports the following sharing scenarios involving
non-public networks, i.e.NG-RAN can be shared by any combination of
PLMNs, PNI-NPNs (with CAG), and SNPNs (each identified by PLMN ID and
NID).

NOTE 1: PNI-NPNs (without CAG) are not explicitly listed above as it
does not require additional NG-RAN sharing functionality compared to
sharing by one or multiple PLMNs.

In all non-public network sharing scenarios, each Cell Identity as
specified in TS 38.331 \[28\] is associated with one of the following
configuration options:

\- one or multiple SNPNs;

\- one or multiple PNI-NPNs (with CAG); or

\- one or multiple PLMNs only.

NOTE 2: This allows the assignment of multiple cell identities to a cell
and also allows the cell identities to be independently assigned, i.e.
without need for coordination, by the network sharing partners, between
PLMNs and/or non-public networks.

NOTE 3: Different PLMN IDs (or combinations of PLMN ID and NID) can also
point to the same 5GC. When same 5GC supports multiple SNPNs (identified
by PLMN ID and NID), then they are not used as equivalent SNPNs for a
UE.

NOTE 4: There is no standardized mechanism to avoid paging collisions if
the same 5G-S-TMSI is allocated to different UEs by different PLMNs or
SNPNs of the shared network, as the risk of paging collision is assumed
to be very low. If such risk is to be eliminated then PLMNs and SNPNs of
the shared network needs to coordinate the value space of the 5G-S-TMSI
to differentiate the PLMNs and SNPNs of the shared network.

![](media/image67.emf)

multiple CNs are\

### 5.18.2 Broadcast system information for network sharing

If a shared NG-RAN is configured to indicate available networks (PLMNs
and/or SNPNs) for selection by UEs, each cell in the shared radio access
network shall in the broadcast system information include available core
network operators in the shared network.

The Broadcast System Information broadcasts a set of PLMN IDs and/or
PLMN IDs and NIDs and one or more additional set of parameters per PLMN
e.g. cell-ID, Tracking Areas, CAG Identifiers. All 5G System capable UEs
that connect to NG-RAN support reception of multiple PLMN IDs and per
PLMN specific parameters. All SNPN-enabled UEs support reception of
multiple combinations of PLMN ID and NID and SNPN-specific parameters.

The available core network operators (PLMNs and/or SNPNs) shall be the
same for all cells of a Tracking Area in a shared NG-RAN network.

UEs not set to operate in SNPN access mode decode the broadcast system
information and take the information concerning available PLMN IDs into
account in PLMN and cell (re-)selection procedures. UEs set to operate
in SNPN access mode decode the broadcast system information and take the
information concerning available PLMN IDs and NIDs into account in
network and cell (re-)selection procedures. Broadcast system information
is specified in TS 38.331 \[28\] for NR, TS 36.331 \[51\] for E-UTRA and
related UE access stratum idle mode procedures in TS 38.304 \[50\] for
NR and TS 36.304 \[52\] for E-UTRA.

### 5.18.2a PLMN list handling for network sharing

The AMF prepares lists of PLMN IDs suitable as target PLMNs for use at
idle mode cell (re)selection and for use at handover and RRC Connection
Release with redirection. The AMF:

\- provides the UE with the list of PLMNs that the UE shall consider as
Equivalent to the serving PLMN (see TS 23.122 \[17\]); and

\- provides the NG-RAN with a prioritised list of permitted PLMNs. When
prioritising these PLMNs, the AMF may consider the following
information: HPLMN of the UE, the serving PLMN, a preferred target PLMN
(e.g. based on last used EPS PLMN), or the policies of the operator(s).

For a UE registered in an SNPN, the AMF shall not provide a list of
equivalent PLMNs to the UE and shall not provide a list of permitted
PLMNs to NG-RAN.

### 5.18.3 Network selection by the UE

NOTE: This clause applies to UEs not operating in SNPN access mode.
Network selection for UEs set to operate in SNPN access mode is
described in clause 5.30.2.4.

A UE that has a subscription to one of the sharing core network
operators shall be able to select this core network operator while
within the coverage area of the shared network and to receive subscribed
services from that core network operator.

Each cell in shared NG-RAN shall in the broadcast system information
include the PLMN-IDs concerning available core network operators in the
shared network.

When a UE performs an Initial Registration to a network, one of
available PLMNs shall be selected to serve the UE. UE uses all the
received broadcast PLMN-IDs in its PLMN (re)selection processes which is
specified in TS 23.122 \[17\]. UE shall inform the NG-RAN of the
selected PLMN so that the NG-RAN can route correctly. The NG-RAN shall
inform the core network of the selected PLMN.

As per any network, after Initial Registration to the shared network and
while remaining served by the shared network, the network selection
procedures specified in TS 23.122 \[17\] may cause the UE to perform a
reselection of another available PLMN.

UE uses all of the received broadcast PLMN-IDs in its cell and PLMN
(re)selection processes.

### 5.18.4 Network selection by the network

The NG-RAN uses the selected PLMN (provided by the UE at RRC
establishment, or, provided by the AMF/source NG-RAN at N2/Xn handover)
to select target cells for future handovers (and radio resources in
general) appropriately. The network should not move the UE to another
available PLMN, e.g. by handover, as long as the selected PLMN is
available to serve the UE\'s location.

In the case of handover or network controlled release to a shared
network:

\- When multiple PLMN IDs are broadcasted in a cell selected by NG-RAN,
NG-RAN shall select a target PLMN, taking into account the prioritized
list of PLMN IDs provided via Mobility Restriction List from AMF.

\- For Xn based HO procedure, Source NG-RAN indicates the selected PLMN
ID to the target NG-RAN, see TS 38.300 \[27\].

\- For N2 based HO procedure, the NG-RAN indicates a selected PLMN ID to
the AMF as part of the TAI sent in the HO required message. Source AMF
uses the TAI information supplied by the source NG-RAN to select the
target AMF/MME. The source AMF should forward the selected PLMN ID to
the target AMF/MME. The target AMF/MME indicates the selected PLMN ID to
the target NG-RAN/eNB so that the target NG-RAN/eNB can select target
cells for future handover appropriately.

\- For RRC connection release with redirection to E-UTRAN procedure,
NG-RAN decides the target network by using PLMN information as defined
in the first bullet.

A change in serving PLMN is indicated to the UE as part of the UE
registration with the selected network via 5G-GUTI in 5GS.

### 5.18.5 Network Sharing and Network Slicing

As defined in clause 5.15.1, a Network Slice is defined within a PLMN or
SNPN. Network sharing is performed among different PLMNs and/or SNPNs.
In the case of network sharing, each PLMN or SNPN sharing the NG-RAN
defines and supports its PLMN- or SNPN- specific set of slices that are
supported by the common NG-RAN.

## 5.19 Control Plane Load Control, Congestion and Overload Control

### 5.19.1 General

In order to ensure that the network functions within 5G System are
operating under nominal capacity for providing connectivity and
necessary services to the UE. Thus, it supports various measures to
guard itself under various operating conditions (e.g. peak operating
hour, extreme situations). It includes support for load (re-)balancing,
overload control and NAS level congestion control. A 5GC NF is
considered to be in overload when it is operating over its nominal
capacity resulting in diminished performance (including impacts to
handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).

### 5.19.2 TNLA Load Balancing and TNLA Load Re-Balancing

AMF can support load balancing and re-balancing of TNL associations
between 5G-AN and AMF by using mechanisms specified in clause 5.21.1.

### 5.19.3 AMF Load Balancing

The AMF Load Balancing functionality permits UEs that are entering into
an AMF Region/AMF Set to be directed to an appropriate AMF in a manner
that achieves load balancing between AMFs. This is achieved by setting a
Weight Factor for each AMF, such that the probability of the 5G-AN
selecting an AMF is proportional to Weight Factor of the AMF. The Weight
Factor is typically set according to the capacity of an AMF node
relative to other AMF nodes. The Weight Factor is sent from the AMF to
the 5G-AN via NGAP messages (see TS 38.413 \[34\]).

NOTE 1: An operator may decide to change the Weight Factor after the
establishment of NGAP connectivity as a result of changes in the AMF
capacities. e.g. a newly installed AMF may be given a very much higher
Weight Factor for an initial period of time making it faster to increase
its load.

NOTE 2: It is intended that the Weight Factor is NOT changed frequently.
e.g. in a mature network, changes on a monthly basis could be
anticipated, e.g. due to the addition of 5G-AN or 5GC nodes.

NOTE 3: Weight Factors for AMF Load Balancing are associated with AMF
Names.

Load balancing by 5G-AN node is only performed between AMFs that belong
to the same AMF set, i.e. AMFs with the same PLMN, AMF Region ID and AMF
Set ID value.

The 5G-AN node may have their Load Balancing parameters adjusted (e.g.
the Weight Factor is set to zero if all subscribers are to be removed
from the AMF, which will route new entrants to other AMFs within an AMF
Set).

### 5.19.4 AMF Load Re-Balancing

The AMF load re-balancing functionality permits cross-section of its
subscribers that are registered on an AMF (within an AMF Set) to be
moved to another AMF within the same AMF set with minimal impacts on the
network and end users. AMF may request some or all of the 5G-AN node(s)
to redirect a cross-section of UE(s) returning from CM-IDLE state to be
redirected to another AMF within the same AMF set, if the 5G-AN is
configured to support this. The AMF may request some or all of the 5G-AN
node(s) to redirect the UEs served by one of its GUAMI(s) to a specific
target AMF within the same AMF set or to any different AMF within the
same AMF set.

When indicating a specific target AMF, the AMF should ensure that the
load re-balancing will not cause overload in the target AMF.

NOTE: This requirement can be fulfilled by the AMF itself or by the OAM.

For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when UE subsequently returns from CM-IDLE
state and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a 5G S-TMSI or
GUAMI pointing to an AMF that requested for redirection, the 5G-AN
should select the specific target AMF (provided by the original AMF) or
a different AMF from the same AMF set and forward the initial NAS
message.

For UE(s) in CONNECTED mode, similar mechanisms for AMF Management can
be used to move the UE to another AMF in the same AMF set as described
in clause 5.21.2, except that the old AMF deregisters itself from NRF.

The newly selected/target AMF (which is now the serving AMF) will
re-assign the GUTI (using its own GUAMI(s)) to the UE(s). It is not
expected that the 5G-AN node rejects any request or enables access
control restriction when it receives a request for redirection for load
control from the connected AMF(s).

When the AMF wants to stop redirection, the AMF can indicate that it can
serve all UE(s) in CM-IDLE state to stop the redirection.

NOTE 1: An example use for the AMF load re-balancing functionality is
for the AMF to pro-actively re-balance its load prior to reaching
overload i.e. to prevent overload situation.

NOTE 2: Typically, AMF Load Re-Balancing is not needed when the AMF
becomes overloaded because the Load Balancing function should have
ensured that the other AMFs within the AMF Set are similarly overloaded.

### 5.19.5 AMF Control Of Overload

#### 5.19.5.1 General

The AMF shall contain mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload
situations. This includes the following measures:

\- N2 overload control that could result in RRC reject, RRC Connection
Release and unified access barring.

\- NAS congestion control.

#### 5.19.5.2 AMF Overload Control

Under unusual circumstances, if AMF has reached overload situation, the
AMF activates NAS level congestion control as specified in Clause 5.19.7
and AMF restricts the load that the 5G-AN node(s) are generating, if the
5G-AN is configured to support overload control. N2 overload control can
be achieved by the AMF invoking the N2 overload procedure (see
TS 38.300 \[27\] and TS 38.413 \[34\]) to all or to a proportion of the
5G-AN nodes with which the AMF has N2 connections. The AMF may include
the S-NSSAI(s) in NGAP OVERLOAD START message sent to 5G-AN node(s) to
indicate the Network Slice(s) with which NAS signalling is to be
restricted. To reflect the amount of load that the AMF wishes to reduce,
the AMF can adjust the proportion of 5G-AN nodes which are sent NGAP
OVERLOAD START message, and the content of the overload start procedure.

When NGAP OVERLOAD START is sent by multiple AMFs or from the same AMF
set in the same PLMN towards the 5G-AN, it should be ensured that the
signalling load is evenly distributed within the PLMN and within each
AMF set.

A 5G-AN node supports restricting of 5G-AN signalling connection when a
signalling connection establishment are attempted by certain UEs (which
are registered or attempting to register with the 5GC), as specified in
TS 38.331 \[28\] and TS 36.331 \[51\]. Additionally, a 5G-AN node
provides support for the barring of UEs as described in TS 22.261 \[2\].
These mechanisms are further specified in TS 38.331 \[28\] and
TS 36.331 \[51\]. For 3GPP Access Type, the signalling connection
establishment attempt includes a RRC Connection Resume procedure from
RRC-Inactive.

By sending the NGAP OVERLOAD START message, the AMF can request the
5G-AN node to apply the following behaviour for UEs that the AMF is
serving:

a\) Restrict 5G-AN signalling connection requests that are not for
emergency, not for exception reporting and not for high priority mobile
originated services; or

b\) Restrict 5G-AN signalling connection requests for uplink NAS
signalling transmission to that AMF;

c\) Restrict 5G-AN signalling connection requests where the Requested
NSSAI at AS layer only includes the indicated S-NSSAI(s) in the NGAP
OVERLOAD START message. This applies also to RRC-Inactive Connection
Resume procedure where the Allowed NSSAI in the stored UE context in the
RAN only includes S-NSSAIs included in the NGAP OVERLOAD START.

d\) only permit 5G-AN signalling connection requests for emergency
sessions and mobile terminated services for that AMF; or

e\) only permit 5G-AN signalling connection requests for high priority
sessions, exception reporting and mobile terminated services for that
AMF;

The above applies for RRC Connection Establishment procedure and RRC
Connection Resume procedures over 3GPP access, as well as for the
UE-N3IWF connection establishment over untrusted Non-3GPP access and for
the UE-TNGF connection establishment over trusted Non-3GPP access.

The AMF can provide a value that indicates the percentage of connection
requests to be restricted in the NGAP OVERLOAD START, and the 5G-AN node
may consider this value for congestion control.

When restricting a 5G-AN signalling connection, the 5G-AN indicates to
the UE an appropriate wait timer that limits further 5G-AN signalling
connection requests until the wait timer expires.

During an overload situation, the AMF should attempt to maintain support
for emergency services and for MPS.

When the AMF is recovering, the AMF can either:

\- send a NGAP OVERLOAD START message with a new percentage value that
permits more connection requests to be successful, or

\- send a NGAP OVERLOAD STOP message.

to the same 5G-AN node(s) the NGAP OVERLOAD START was previously sent.

### 5.19.6 SMF Overload Control

The SMF shall contain mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload
situations. This can include the following measures:

\- SMF overload control that could result in rejections of NAS requests.

The SMF overload control may be activated by SMF due to congestion
situation at SMF e.g. configuration, by a restart or recovery condition
of a UPF, or by a partial failure or recovery of a UPF for a particular
UPF(s).

Under unusual circumstances, if the SMF has reached overload situation,
the SMF activates NAS level congestion control as specified in
clause 5.19.7. The SMF may restrict the load that the AMF(s) are
generating, if the AMF is configured to enable the overload restriction.

### 5.19.7 NAS level congestion control

#### 5.19.7.1 General

NAS level congestion control may be applied in general (i.e. for all NAS
messages), per DNN, per S-NSSAI, per DNN and S-NSSAI, or for a specific
group of UEs.

NAS level congestion control is achieved by providing the UE a back-off
time. To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests
(almost) simultaneously, the 5GC should select each back-off time value
so that the deferred requests are not synchronized. When the UE receives
a back-off time, the UE shall not initiate any NAS signalling with
regards to the applied congestion control until the back-off timer
expires or the UE receives a mobile terminated request from the network,
or the UE initiates signalling for emergency services or high priority
access.

AMFs and SMFs may apply NAS level congestion control, but should not
apply NAS level congestion control for procedures not subject to
congestion control.

#### 5.19.7.2 General NAS level congestion control

This clause only applies to NAS Mobility Management congestion control.

Under general overload conditions the AMF may reject NAS messages from
UEs using any 5G-AN. When a NAS request is rejected, a Mobility
Management back-off time may be sent by the AMF to the UE. While the
Mobility Management back-off timer is running, the UE shall not initiate
any NAS request except for Deregistration procedure and procedures not
subject to congestion control (e.g. high priority access, emergency
services) and mobile terminated services. After any such Deregistration
procedure, the back-off timer continues to run. While the Mobility
Management back-off timer is running, the UE is allowed to perform
Mobility Registration Update if the UE is already in CM-CONNECTED state.
If the UE receives a paging request or a NAS notification message from
the AMF while the Mobility Management back off timer is running, the UE
shall stop the Mobility Management back-off timer and initiate the
Service Request procedure or the Mobility Registration Update procedure
over 3GPP access and/or non-3GPP access as applicable. Over non-3GPP
access, if the UE is in CM-IDLE state when the back-off timer is
stopped, it shall initiate the UE-triggered Service Request procedure as
soon as it switches back to CM-CONNECTED state.

In order to allow the UE to report the PS Data Off status change in PDU
Session Modification Request message, the UE behaves as follows while
keeping the NAS MM back-off timer running in the UE:

\- When the UE is in CM-IDLE state and has not moved out of the
Registration Area, the UE is allowed to send a Service Request message
with an indication that the message is exempted from NAS congestion
control. When the UE is in CM-IDLE mode and has moved out of the
Registration Area, the UE is allowed to send a Mobility Registration
Update request message, with a Follow-on request, and with an indication
that the message is exempted from NAS congestion control.

\- When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the UE sends a PDU Session
Modification Request with PS Data Off status change carried in UL NAS
Transport message with an indication that the message is exempted from
NAS congestion control.

When the NAS MM congestion control is activated at AMF, if the UE
indicates that the NAS MM message is exempted from NAS congestion
control, the AMF shall not reject the NAS MM message and shall forward
the NAS SM message to the corresponding SMF with an indication that the
NAS SM message was indicated to be exempted from NAS congestion control.
The SMF ensures that the NAS SM message is not subject to congestion
control otherwise the SMF rejects the message, e.g. the SMF shall reject
PDU Session Modification received if it is not for Data Off status
reporting.

The Mobility Management back-off timer shall not impact Cell/RAT/Access
Type and PLMN change. Cell/RAT/TA/Access Type change does not stop the
Mobility Management back-off timer. The Mobility Management back-off
timer shall not be a trigger for PLMN reselection. The back-off timer is
stopped as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\] when a new PLMN that is not an
equivalent PLMN is accessed.

To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)
simultaneously, the AMF should select the Mobility Management back-off
timer value so that the deferred requests are not synchronized.

If the UE required to report 5GSM Core Network Capability change, or the
Always-on PDU Session Requested indication while the NAS MM congestion
control timer was running and was unable to initiate MM signalling, the
UE defers the related MM signalling until the MM congestion control
timer expires and initiates after the expiry of the timer.

In the case of a UE with scheduled communication pattern, the AMF may
consider the UE\'s communication pattern while selecting a value for the
Mobility Management back-off timer so that the UE does not miss its only
scheduled communication window.

The AMF should not reject Registration Request message for Mobility
Registration Update that are performed when the UE is already in
CM-CONNECTED state.

The AMF may reject the Service Request message and a UL NAS Transfer
with a Mobility Management back-off time when the UE is already in
CM-CONNECTED state. If UE receives a DL NAS Transfer message from the
AMF while the Mobility Management back off timer is running, the UE
shall stop the Mobility Management back-off timer.

For CM-IDLE state mobility, the AMF may reject Registration Request
messages for Mobility Registration Update by including a Mobility
Management back off time value in the Registration Reject message.

If UE registered in the same PLMN for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
and receives a Mobility Management back-off time from the AMF, the
back-off time (and corresponding start and stop) is applied equally to
both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. If UE registered in different
PLMNs for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access respectively and receives a
Mobility Management back-off time, the back-off time is only applied to
the PLMN that provides the time to the UE.

If the AMF rejects Registration Request messages or Service Request with
a Mobility Management back-off time which is larger than the sum of the
UE\'s Periodic Registration Update timer and the Implicit Deregistration
timer, the AMF should adjust the mobile reachable timer and/or Implicit
Deregistration timer such that the AMF does not implicitly deregister
the UE while the Mobility Management back-off timer is running.

NOTE: This is to minimize signalling after the Mobility Management
back-off timer expires.

If the AMF deregisters the UE with an indication of re-registration
required, the UE behaviour for handling the back-off timer(s) is as
specified in TS 24.501 \[47\].

#### 5.19.7.3 DNN based congestion control

DNN based congestion control is designed for the purpose of avoiding and
handling of NAS SM signalling congestion for the UEs with a back-off
timer associated with or without a DNN regardless of the presence of an
S-NSSAI. Both UE and 5GC shall support the functionality to enable DNN
based congestion control.

SMFs may apply DNN based congestion control towards the UE by rejecting
PDU Session Establishment Request message, or PDU Session Modification
Request message except for those sent for the purpose of reporting 3GPP
PS Data Off status change for a specific DNN with a running back-off
timer. The SMF may release PDU Sessions belonging to a congested DNN by
sending a PDU Session Release Command message towards the UE with a DNN
back-off timer. If a DNN back-off time is set in the PDU Session Release
Command message, the cause value of \"reactivation requested\" shall not
be set.

If NWDAF is deployed, the SMF may make use of Session Management
Congestion Control Experience analytics provided by NWDAF, as defined in
clause 6.12 of TS 23.288 \[86\], to determine back-off timer provided to
UEs.

NOTE: For example, the SMF can apply a short back-off timer to the UEs
in the list of high-experienced UEs while the SMF can apply a long
back-off timer to the UEs in the list of low-experienced UEs.

When DNN based congestion control is activated at AMF e.g. configured by
OAM, the AMF provides a NAS Transport Error message for the NAS
Transport message carrying an SM message, and in the NAS Transport Error
message it includes a DNN back-off timer.

The UE associates the received back-off time with the DNN (i.e. no DNN,
DNN only) which the UE included in the uplink NAS MM message carrying
the corresponding NAS SM request message.

The UE associates the received back-off time with the DNN (i.e. no DNN,
DNN only) in any PLMN unless the DNN associated with the back-off timer
is an LADN DNN in which case the UE only associates it to the PLMN in
which the back-off time was received.

The UE behaves as follows when the DNN back-off timer is running:

\- If a DNN is associated with the back-off timer, the UE shall not
initiate any Session Management procedures for the congested DNN. The UE
may initiate Session Management procedures for other DNNs. The UE shall
not initiate any Session Management procedure for the corresponding APN
when UE moves to EPS. The UE may initiate Session Management procedures
for other APNs when the UE moves to EPS;

\- If no DNN is associated with the back-off timer, the UE may only
initiate Session Management requests of any PDU Session Type for a
specific DNN;

\- Upon Cell/TA/PLMN/RAT change, change of untrusted non-3GPP access
network or change of Access Type, the UE shall not stop the back-off
timer;

\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedures for
high priority access and emergency services;

\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedure for
reporting Data Off status change to the network;

\- If the UE receives a network initiated Session Management message
other than PDU Session Release Command for the congested DNN associated
to a running back-off timer, the UE shall stop the back-off timer and
respond to the 5GC;

\- If the UE receives a PDU Session Release Command message for the
congested DNN, it shall stop the back-off timer unless it receives a new
back-off time from SMF;

\- The UE is allowed to initiate PDU Session Release procedure (i.e.
sending PDU Session Release Request message). The UE shall not stop the
back-off timer when the related PDU Session is released;

\- The list above is not an exhaustive list, i.e. more details of the
above actions and further conditions, if any, are specified in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

If UE initiates one of the Session Management procedures that are
exempted from NAS congestion control, the UE indicates that the carried
NAS SM message is exempted from NAS congestion control in the UL NAS
Transport message as described in TS 24.501 \[47\]. When the DNN based
congestion control is activated at AMF, if the UE indicates that the NAS
SM message in the UL NAS Transport message is exempted from NAS
congestion control, the AMF shall not apply DNN based congestion control
on the UL NAS Transport message and shall forward the NAS SM message to
the corresponding SMF with an indication that the message was received
with exemption indication. The SMF evaluates whether the NAS SM message
is allowed to be exempted from DNN based congestion control. If it is
not, the SMF rejects the message, e.g. the SMF shall reject PDU Session
Modification received if it is not for Data Off status reporting).

The UE shall maintain a separate back-off timer for each DNN that the UE
may use.

To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)
simultaneously, the 5GC should select the back-off timer value so that
deferred requests are not synchronized.

If the UE required to report 5GSM Core Network Capability change, or the
Always-on PDU Session Requested indication while DNN based congestion
control was running and was unable to initiate SM signalling, the UE
defers the related SM signalling until the DNN based congestion control
timer expires and initiates the necessary SM signalling after the expiry
of the timer.

The DNN based Session Management congestion control is applicable to the
NAS SM signalling initiated from the UE in the Control Plane. The
Session Management congestion control does not prevent the UE from
sending and receiving data or initiating Service Request procedures for
activating User Plane connection towards the DNN(s) that are under
Session Management congestion control.

#### 5.19.7.4 S-NSSAI based congestion control

S-NSSAI based congestion control is designed for the purpose of avoiding
and handling of NAS signalling congestion for the UEs with back-off
timer associated with or without an S-NSSAI regardless of the presence
of a DNN.

The UE associates the received back-off time with the S-NSSAI and DNN
(i.e. no S-NSSAI and no DNN, no S-NSSAI, S-NSSAI only, an S-NSSAI and a
DNN) which was included in the uplink NAS MM message carrying the
corresponding NAS SM request message for the PLMN which is under
congestion.

S-NSSAI based congestion control is applied as follows:

\- If an S-NSSAI is determined as congested, then the SMF may apply
S-NSSAI based congestion control towards the UE for SM requests except
for those sent for the purpose of reporting 3GPP PS Data Off status
change for a specific S-NSSAI and provides a back-off time and an
indication of HPLMN congestion;

\- If the UE receives an S-NSSAI based back-off time without an
indication of HPLMN congestion, the UE shall apply the S-NSSAI back-off
timer only in the PLMN in which the back-off time was received. If the
UE receives S-NSSAI based back-off time with an indication of HPLMN
congestion, the UE shall apply the S-NSSAI based back-off timer in the
PLMN in which the back-off time was received and in any other PLMN;

\- The SMF may release PDU Sessions belonging to a congested S-NSSAI by
sending a PDU Session Release Request message towards the UE with a
back-off time associated either to the S-NSSAI only (i.e. with no
specific DNN) or a combination of the S-NSSAI and a specific DNN. If
NWDAF is deployed, the SMF may make use of Session Management Congestion
Control Experience analytics provided by NWDAF, as defined in
clause 6.12 of TS 23.288 \[86\], to determine back-off timer provided to
UEs;

NOTE: For example, the SMF can apply a short back-off timer to the UEs
in the list of high-experienced UEs while the SMF can apply a long
back-off timer to the UEs in the list of low-experienced UEs.

\- If S-NSSAI based congestion control is activated at AMF e.g.
configured by OAM and an S-NSSAI is determined as congested, then the
AMF applies S-NSSAI based congestion control towards the UE for
UE-initiated Session Management requests. In this case, the AMF provides
a NAS Transport Error message for the NAS Transport message carrying the
SM message, and in the NAS Transport Error message it includes a
back-off timer; If NWDAF is deployed, the AMF may determine that S-NSSAI
is congested based on the network slice load level analytics defined in
TS 23.288 \[86\].

\- The UE behaves as follows in the PLMN where the S-NSSAI based
congestion control applies when the back-off timer is running:

\- If the back-off timer was associated with an S-NSSAI only (i.e. not
associated with an S-NSSAI and a DNN), the UE shall not initiate any
Session Management procedures for the congested S-NSSAI;

\- If the back-off timer was associated with an S-NSSAI and a DNN, then
the UE shall not initiate any Session Management procedures for that
combination of S-NSSAI and DNN;

\- If the UE receives a network-initiated Session Management message
other than PDU Session Release Command for the congested S-NSSAI, the UE
shall stop this back-off timer and respond to the 5GC;

\- If the UE receives a PDU Session Release Command message for the
congested S-NSSAI, it shall stop the back-off timer unless it receives a
new back-off time from SMF;

\- Upon Cell/TA/PLMN/RAT change, change of untrusted non-3GPP access
network or change of Access Type, the UE shall not stop the back-off
timer for any S-NSSAI or any combination of S-NSSAI and DNN;

\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedures for
high priority access and emergency services for the S-NSSAI;

\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedure for
reporting Data Off status change for the S-NSSAI or the combination of
S-NSSAI and DNN.

\- If the back-off timer is not associated to any S-NSSAI, the UE may
only initiate Session Management procedures for specific S-NSSAI;

\- If the back-off timer is not associated to any S-NSSAI and DNN, the
UE may only initiate Session Management procedures for specific S-NSSAI
and DNN;

\- The UE is allowed to initiate PDU Session Release procedure (e.g.
sending PDU Session Release Request message). The UE shall not stop the
back-off timer when the related PDU Session is released;

\- The list above is not an exhaustive list, i.e. more details of the
above actions and further conditions, if any, are specified in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

The UE shall maintain a separate back-off timer for each S-NSSAI and for
each combination of S-NSSAI and DNN that the UE may use.

If UE initiates one of the Session Management procedure that are exempt
from NAS congestion control, the UE indicates that the carried NAS SM
message is exempted from NAS congestion control in the UL NAS Transport
message as described in TS 24.501 \[47\]. When the S-NSSAI based
congestion control is activated at AMF, if the UE indicates that the NAS
SM message in the UL NAS Transport message is exempted from NAS
congestion control, the AMF shall not apply S-NSSAI based congestion
control on the UL NAS Transport message and shall forward the NAS SM
message to the corresponding SMF with an indication that the message was
received with exemption indication. The SMF evaluates whether that the
NAS SM message is allowed to be exempted from S-NSSAI based congestion
control. If it is not, the SMF rejects the message, e.g. the SMF shall
reject PDU Session Modification received if it is not for Data Off
status reporting.

The back-off timer associated with an S-NSSAI or a combination of an
S-NSSAI and a DNN shall only apply to congestion control for Session
Management procedures when UE is in 5GS.

To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)
simultaneously, the 5GC should select the value of the back-off timer
for the S-NSSAI based congestion control so that deferred requests are
not synchronized.

If the UE required to report 5GSM Core Network Capability change, or the
Always-on PDU Session Requested indication while S-NSSAI based
congestion control timer was running and was unable to initiate SM
signalling, the UE defers the related SM signalling until the S-NSSAI
based congestion control timer expires and initiates the necessary SM
signalling after the expiry of the timer.

The S-NSSAI based congestion control does not prevent the UE from
sending and receiving data or initiating Service Request procedure for
activating User Plane connection for a PDU Session associated to the
S-NSSAI that is under the congestion control.

#### 5.19.7.5 Group specific NAS level congestion control

The group specific NAS level congestion control applies to a specific
group of UEs. Group specific NAS level congestion control is performed
at the 5GC only, and it is transparent to UE. The AMF or SMF or both may
apply NAS level congestion control for a UE associated to an
Internal-Group Identifier (see clause 5.9.7).

NOTE: 5GC logic for Group specific NAS level congestion control is not
described in this Release of the specification.

#### 5.19.7.6 Control Plane data specific NAS level congestion control

Under overload conditions the AMF may restrict requests from UEs for
data transmission via Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. A Control
Plane data back-off timer may be returned by the AMF (e.g. in
Registration Accept messages, Service Reject message or Service Accept
message). While the Control Plane data back-off timer is running, the UE
shall not initiate any data transfer via Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation, i.e. the UE shall not send any Control Plane Service
Request with uplink data as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\]. The AMF shall
store the Control Plane data back-off timer per UE and shall not process
any further requests (other than exception reporting and a response to
paging) for Data Transport via a Control Plane Service Request from that
UE while the Control Plane data back-off timer is still running.

NOTE 1: The Control Plane data back-off timer does not affect any other
mobility management or session management procedure.

NOTE 2: The Control Plane data back-off timer does not apply to user
plane data communication.

If the UE is allowed to send exception reporting, the UE may send an
initial NAS Message for exception reporting even if Control Plane data
back-off timer is running.

The UE may respond to paging with an initial NAS Message without uplink
data even if the Control Plane data back-off timer is running.

If the AMF receives an initial NAS Message in reponse to a paging, and
the AMF has a Control Plane data back-off timer running for the UE, and
the AMF is not overloaded, and AMF decides to accept the Control Plane
Service Request, then the AMF shall respond with Service Accept without
the Control Plane data back-off timer and stop the Control Plane data
back-off timer. If the UE receives a Service Accept without the Control
Plane data back-off timer from the AMF while the Control Plane data
back-off timer is running, the UE shall stop the Control Plane data
back-off timer. The Control Plane data back-off timer in the UE and the
AMF is stopped at PLMN change.

If the AMF receives a Control Plane Service Request with uplink data,
and decides to send the UE a Control Plane data back-off timer, the AMF
may decide to process the Control Plane Service Request with uplink
data, i.e. decrypt and forward the data payload, or not based on the
following:

\- If the UE has indicated Release Assistance Information that no
further Uplink and Downlink Data transmissions are expected, then the
AMF may process (integrity check/decipher/forward) the received Control
Plane data packet, and send a Service Accept to the UE with Control
Plane data back-off timer. The UE interprets this as successful
transmission of the Control Plane data packet starts the Control Plane
data back-off timer.

\- For all other cases, the AMF may decide to not process the received
Control Plane data packet and send a Service Reject to the UE with
Control Plane data back-off timer. The UE interprets this indication as
unsuccessful delivery of the control plane data packet and starts the
Control Plane data back-off timer. The AMF may take into consideration
whether the PDU Session is set to Control Plane only to make the
decision whether to reject the packet and send Service Reject or move
the PDU Session to user plane and process the data packet as described
in next bullet.

\- Alternatively, if UE has not provided Release Assistance Information,
and the PDU Session not set to Control Plane only, and UE supports N3
data transfer, then the AMF may initiate establishment of N3 bearer
according to the procedure defined in clause 4.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].
In this case the AMF may also return a Control Plane data back-off timer
within the Service Accept.

The AMF only includes the Control Plane data back-off timer if the UE
has indicated support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimizations in the
Registration Request.

## 5.20 External Exposure of Network Capability

The Network Exposure Function (NEF) supports external exposure of
capabilities of network functions. External exposure can be categorized
as Monitoring capability, Provisioning capability, Policy/Charging
capability and Analytics reporting capability. The Monitoring capability
is for monitoring of specific event for UE in 5G System and making such
monitoring events information available for external exposure via the
NEF. The Provisioning capability is for allowing external party to
provision of information which can be used for the UE in 5G System. The
Policy/Charging capability is for handling access and mobility
management, QoS and charging policies for the UE based on the request
from external party. The Analytics reporting capability is for allowing
an external party to fetch or subscribe/unsubscribe to analytics
information generated by 5G System (this is further defined in
TS 23.288 \[86\]).

Monitoring capability is comprised of means that allow the
identification of the 5G network function suitable for configuring the
specific monitoring events, detect the monitoring event, and report the
monitoring event to the authorised external party. Monitoring capability
can be used for exposing UE\'s mobility management context such as UE
location, reachability, roaming status, and loss of connectivity. AMF
stores URRP-AMF information in the MM context to determine the NFs that
are authorised to receive direct notifications from the AMF. UDM stores
URRP-AMF information locally to determine authorised monitoring requests
when forwarding indirect notifications.

Provisioning capability allows an external party to provision the
Expected UE Behaviour or the 5G-VN group information or ECS Address
Configuration Information or service specific information to 5G NF via
the NEF. The provisioning comprises of the authorisation of the
provisioning external third party, receiving the provisioned external
information via the NEF, storing the information, and distributing that
information among those NFs that use it. The externally provisioned data
can be consumed by different NFs, depending on the data. In the case of
provisioning the Expected UE Behaviour, the externally provisioned
information which is defined as the Expected UE Behaviour parameters in
clause 4.15.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\] or Network Control parameter in
clause 4.15.6.3a of TS 23.502 \[3\] consists of information on expected
UE movement, Expected UE Behaviour parameters or expected Network
Configuration parameter. The provisioned Expected UE Behaviour
parameters may be used for the setting of mobility management or session
management parameters of the UE. In the case of provisioning the 5G-VN
group information the externally provisioned information is defined as
the 5G-VN group parameters in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\] and it
consists of some information on the 5G-VN group. In the case of
provisioning ECS address, the externally provisioned information is
defined as the ECS Address Configuration Information in clause 4.15.6.3d
of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The affected NFs are informed via the subscriber
data update as specified in clause 4.15.6.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The
externally provisioned information which is defined as the Service
Parameters in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\] consists of service
specific information used for supporting the specific service in 5G
system. The provisioned Service Parameters may be delivered to the UEs.
The affected NFs are informed of the data update.

Policy/Charging capability is comprised of means that allow the request
for session and charging policy, enforce QoS policy, apply accounting
functionality and requests to influence access and mobility management
policies. It can be used for specific QoS/priority handling for the
session of the UE, and for setting applicable charging party or charging
rate.

Analytics reporting capability is comprised of means that allow
discovery of type of analytics that can be consumed by external party,
the request for consumption of analytics information generated by NWDAF.

An NEF may support CAPIF functions for external exposure as specified in
clause 6.2.5.1.

An NEF may support exposure of NWDAF analytics as specified in
TS 23.288 \[86\].

The NEF may support exposure of 5GS and/or UE availability and
capabilities for time synchronization service as specified in
clause 5.27.1.8.

An NEF may support exposure of event based notifications and reports for
NSACF as specified in clause 5.15.11.

An AF may only be able to identify the target UE of an AF request for
external exposure of 5GC capabilities (e.g. Data Provisioning or for
Event Exposure for a specific UE) by providing the UE\'s address
information. In this case the NEF first needs to retrieve the Permanent
identifier of the UE before trying to fulfil the AF request. The NEF may
determine the Permanent identifier of the UE, as described in
clause 4.15.3.2.13 of TS 23.502 \[3\], based on:

\- the address of the UE as provided by the AF; this may be an IP
address or a MAC address;

\- the corresponding DNN and/or S-NSSAI information: this may have been
provided by the AF or determined by the NEF based on the requesting AF;
this is needed if the UE address is an IP address.

The NEF may provide an AF specific UE Identifier to the AF:

\- that has explicitly requested a translation from the address of the
UE to a unique UE identifier (via Nnef_UEId service); or

\- that has implicitly requested a translation from the address of the
UE to a AF specific UE Identifier by requesting external exposure about
an individual UE identified by its address.

The AF may have its own means to maintain the AF specific UE Identifier
through, e.g. an AF session. After the retrieval of an AF specific UE
Identifier the AF shall not keep maintaining a mapping between this
identifier and the UE IP address as this mapping may change.

The AF specific UE Identifier shall not correspond to a MSISDN; it is
represented as a GPSI in the form of an External Identifier. When used
as an AF specific UE identifier, the External Identifier provided by the
5GCN shall be different for different AF.

NOTE 1: This is to protect user privacy.

NOTE 2: How to enforce that the AF specific UE Identifier is different
for different AFs is defined in TS 33.501 \[29\].

## 5.20a Data Collection from an AF

An NF that needs to collect data from an AF may subscribe/unsubscribe to
notifications regarding data collected from an AF, either directly from
the AF or via NEF.

The data collected from an AF is used as input for analytics by the
NWDAF.

The details for the data collected from an AF as well as interactions
between NEF, AF and NWDAF are described in TS 23.288 \[86\].

## 5.21 Architectural support for virtualized deployments

### 5.21.0 General

5GC supports different virtualized deployment scenarios, including but
not limited to the options below:

\- A Network Function instance can be deployed as distributed,
redundant, stateless, and scalable NF instance that provides the
services from several locations and several execution instances in each
location.

\- This type of deployments would typically not require support for
addition or removal of NF instances for redundancy and scalability. In
the case of an AMF this deployment option may use enablers like,
addition of TNLA, removal of TNLA, TNLA release and rebinding of NGAP UE
association to a new TNLA to the same AMF.

\- A Network Function instance can also be deployed such that several
network function instances are present within a NF set provide
distributed, redundant, stateless and scalability together as a set of
NF instances.

\- This type of deployments may support for addition or removal of NF
instances for redundancy and scalability. In the case of an AMF this
deployment option may use enablers like, addition of AMFs and TNLAs,
removal of AMFs and TNLAs, TNLA release and rebinding of NGAP UE
associations to a new TNLA to different AMFs in the same AMF set.

\- The SEPP, although not a Network Function instance, can also be
deployed distributed, redundant, stateless, and scalable.

\- The SCP, although not a Network Function instance, can also be
deployed distributed, redundant, and scalable.

Also, deployments taking advantage of only some or any combination of
concepts from each of the above options is possible.

### 5.21.1 Architectural support for N2

#### 5.21.1.1 TNL associations

5G-AN node shall have the capability to support multiple TNL
associations per AMF, i.e. AMF name.

An AMF shall provide the 5G-AN node with the weight factors for each TNL
association of the AMF.

The AMF shall be able to request the 5G-AN node to add or remove TNL
associations to the AMF.

The AMF shall be able to indicate to the 5G-AN node the set of TNL
associations used for UE-associated signalling and the set of TNL
associations used for non-UE associated signalling.

NOTE: The TNL association(s) indicated for UE-associated and non-UE
associated signalling can either be overlap or be different.

#### 5.21.1.2 NGAP UE-TNLA-binding

While a UE is in CM-Connected state the 5G-AN node shall maintain the
same NGAP UE-TNLA-binding (i.e. use the same TNL association and same
NGAP association for the UE) unless explicitly changed or released by
the AMF.

An AMF shall be able to update the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding (i.e. change the
TNL association for the UE) in CM-CONNECTED state at any time. The NGAP
UE-TNLA-binding can also be updated when a UE-specific NGAP message
initiated by AMF is received via a new TNL association.

An AMF shall be able to update the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding (i.e. change the
TNL association for the UE) in response to an N2 message received from
the 5G-AN by triangular redirection (e.g. by responding to the 5G-AN
node using a different TNL association).

An AMF shall be able to command the 5G-AN node to release the NGAP
UE-TNLA-binding for a UE in CM-CONNECTED state while maintaining N3
(user-plane connectivity) for the UE at any time.

#### 5.21.1.3 N2 TNL association selection

The 5G-AN node shall consider the following factors for selecting a TNL
association for the AMF for the initial N2 message e.g. N2 INITIAL UE
MESSAGE:

\- Availability of candidate TNL associations.

\- Weight factors of candidate TNL associations.

The AMF may use any TNL association intended for non-UE associated
signalling for initiation of the N2 Paging procedure.

### 5.21.2 AMF Management

#### 5.21.2.1 AMF Addition/Update

The 5G System should support establishment of association between AMF
and 5G-AN node.

A new AMF can be added to an AMF set and association between AMF and
GUAMI can be created and/or updated as follows:

\- AMF shall be able to dynamically update the NRF with the new or
updated GUAMI(s) to provide mapping between GUAMI(s) and AMF
information. Association between GUAMI(s) and AMF is published to NRF.
In addition, to deal with planned maintenance and failure, an AMF may
optionally provide backup AMF information, i.e. it act as a backup AMF
if the indicated GUAMI associated AMF is unavailable. It is assumed that
the backup AMF and the original AMF are in the same AMF set as they have
access to the same UE context. Based on that information one GUAMI is
associated with an AMF, optionally with a backup AMF used for planned
removal and/or another (same or different) backup AMF used for failure.

\- Upon successful update, the NRF considers the new and/or updated
GUAMI(s) for providing AMF discovery results to the requester. Requester
can be other CP network functions.

\- The new AMF provides its GUAMI to 5G-AN and 5G-AN store this
association. If the association between the same GUAMI and another AMF
exists in the 5G-AN (e.g. due to AMF planned removal), the previously
stored AMF is replaced by the new AMF for the corresponding GUAMI
association.

Information about new AMF should be published and available in the DNS
system. It should allow 5G-AN to discover AMF and setup associations
with the AMF required. N2 setup procedure should allow the possibility
of AMFs within the AMF Set to advertise the same AMF Pointer and/or
distinct AMF Pointer value(s) to the 5G-AN node.

To support the legacy EPC core network entity (i.e. MME) to discover and
communicate with the AMF, the information about the AMF should be
published and available in the DNS system. Furthermore, GUMMEI and GUAMI
encoding space should be partitioned to avoid overlapping values in
order to enable MME discover an AMF without ambiguity.

#### 5.21.2.2 AMF planned removal procedure

##### 5.21.2.2.1 AMF planned removal procedure with UDSF deployed

An AMF can be taken graciously out of service as follows:

\- If an UDSF is deployed in the network, then the AMF stores the
context for registered UE(s) in the UDSF. The UE context includes the
AMF UE NGAP ID that is unique per AMF set. In order for the AMF planned
removal procedure to work graciously, 5G-S-TMSI shall be unique per AMF
Set. If there are ongoing transactions (e.g. N1 procedure) for certain
UE(s), AMF stores the UE context(s) in the UDSF upon completion of an
ongoing transaction.

\- The AMF deregister itself from NRF indicating due to AMF planned
removal.

NOTE 1: It is assumed that the UE contexts from the old AMF include all
event subscriptions with peer CP NFs.

NOTE 2: Before removal of AMF the overload control mechanism can be used
to reduce the amount of ongoing transaction.

An AMF identified by GUAMI(s) shall be able to notify the 5G-AN that it
will be unavailable for processing transactions by including GUAMI(s)
configured on this AMF. Upon receipt of the indication that an
AMF(identified by GUAMI(s)) is unavailable, 5G-AN shall take the
following action:

\- 5G-AN should mark this AMF as unavailable and not consider the AMF
for selection for subsequent N2 transactions until 5G-AN learns that it
is available (e.g. as part of discovery results or by configuration).

\- During NGAP Setup procedure, the AMF may include an additional
indicator that the AMF will rebind or release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding
on a per UE-basis for UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state. If that indicator is
included and the 5G-AN supports timer mechanism, the 5G-AN starts a
timer to control the release of NGAP UE-TNLA-binding. For the duration
of the timer or until the AMF releases or re-binds the NGAP
UE-TNLA-binding the AN does not select a new AMF for subsequent UE
transactions. Upon timer expiry, the 5G-AN releases the NGAP UE
UE-TNLA-binding(s) with the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s),
for subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN should select a different AMF from
the same AMF set when the subsequent N2 message needs to be sent.

NOTE 3: For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, after indicating that the AMF
is unavailable for processing UE transactions and including an indicator
that the AMF releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s) on a per UE-basis, the
AMF can either trigger a re-binding of the NGAP UE associations to an
available TNLA on a different AMF in the same AMF set or use the NGAP
UE-TNLA-binding per UE release procedure defined in TS 23.502 \[3\] to
release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding on a per UE-basis while requesting the
AN to maintain N3 (user plane connectivity) and UE context information.

NOTE 4: The support and the use of timer mechanism in 5G-AN is up to
implementation.

\- If the instruction does not include the indicator, for UE(s) in
CM-CONNECTED state, 5G-AN considers this as a request to release the
NGAP UE-TNLA-binding with the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s)
while maintaining N3 (user plane connectivity) and UE context
information. For subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN should select a
different AMF from the same AMF set when the subsequent N2 message needs
to be sent.

\- For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when it subsequently returns from CM-IDLE
state and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a 5G S-TMSI or
GUAMI pointing to an AMF that is marked unavailable, the 5G-AN should
select a different AMF from the same AMF set and forward the initial NAS
message. If the 5G-AN can\'t select an AMF from the same AMF set, the
5G-AN selects another new AMF as described in clause 6.3.5.

An AMF identified by GUAMI(s) shall be able to instruct other peer CP
NFs, subscribed to receive such a notification, that it will be
unavailable for processing transactions by including GUAMI(s) configured
on this AMF. If the CP NFs register with NRF for AMF unavailable
notification, then the NRF shall be able to notify the subscribed NFs to
receive such a notification that AMF identified by GUAMI(s) will be
unavailable for processing transactions. Upon receipt of the
notification that an AMF (GUAMI(s)) is unavailable, the other CP NFs
shall take the following actions:

\- CP NF should mark this AMF (identified by GUAMI(s)) as unavailable
and not consider the AMF for selection for subsequent MT transactions
until the CP NF learns that it is available (e.g. as part of NF
discovery results or via NF status notification from NRF).

\- Mark this AMF as unavailable while not changing the status of UE(s)
associated to this AMF (UE(s) previously served by the corresponding AMF
still remain registered in the network), and AMF Set information.

\- For the UE(s) that were associated to the corresponding AMF, when the
peer CP NF needs to initiate a transaction towards the AMF that is
marked unavailable, CP NF should select another AMF from the same AMF
set (as in clause 6.3.5) and forward the transaction together with the
old GUAMI. The new AMF retrieves UE context from the UDSF. If CP NF
needs to send a notification to new AMF which is associated with a
subscription from the old AMF, the CP NF shall exchange the old AMF
information embedded in the Notification Address with the new AMF
information, and use that Notification Address for subsequent
communication.

NOTE 5: If the CP NF does not subscribe to receive AMF unavailable
notification (either directly from the AMF or via NRF), the CP NF may
attempt forwarding the transaction towards the old AMF and detect that
the AMF is unavailable after certain number of attempts. When it detects
unavailable, it marks the AMF and its associated GUAMI(s) as
unavailable. CP NF should select another AMF from the same AMF set (as
in clause 6.3.5) and forward the transaction together with the old
GUAMI. The new AMF retrieves UE context from the UDSF and process the
transaction.

Following actions should be performed by the newly selected AMF:

\- When there is a transaction with the UE the newly selected AMF
retrieves the UE context from the UDSF based on SUPI, 5G-GUTI or AMF UE
NGAP ID and processes the UE message accordingly and updates the 5G-GUTI
towards the UE, if necessary. For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, it may
also update the NGAP UE association with a new AMF UE NGAP ID towards
the 5G-AN and replace the GUAMI in the UE context stored at the 5G-AN
with the new GUAMI associated with the newly selected AMF if the 5G-GUTI
has been updated. The AMF also informs the NG-RAN of the new UE Identity
Index Value (derived from the new 5G-GUTI).

\- When there is a transaction with the UE, the new selected AMF updates
the peer NFs (that subscribed to receive AMF unavailability notification
from old AMF), with the new selected AMF information.

\- If the new AMF is aware of a different AMF serving the UE (by
implementation specific means) it forwards the uplink N2 signalling of
the UE to that AMF directly if necessary, the 5G-AN shall be able to
receive the message from a different AMF, or it rejects the transaction
from the peer CP NFs with a cause to indicate that new AMF has been
selected, the peer CP NFs resend the transaction to the new AMF.

NOTE 6: This bullet above addresses situations where 5G-AN node selects
an AMF and CP NFs select another AMF for the UE concurrently. It also
addresses the situation where CP NFs select an AMF for the UE
concurrently

\- If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the new AMF does not have access to
the UE context, the new AMF selects one available AMF from the old AMF
set as described in clause 6.3.5. The selected AMF retrieves the UE
context from the UDSF and provides the UE context to the new AMF. If the
new AMF doesn\'t receive the UE context then the AMF may force the UE to
perform Initial Registration.

##### 5.21.2.2.2 AMF planned removal procedure without UDSF

An AMF can be taken graciously out of service as follows:

\- The AMF can forward registered UE contexts, UE contexts grouped by
the same GUAMI value, to target AMF(s) within the same AMF set,
including the source AMF name used for redirecting UE\'s MT transaction.
The UE context includes the per AMF Set unique AMF UE NGAP ID. In order
for the AMF planned removal procedure to work graciously, 5G-S-TMSI
shall be unique per AMF set. If there are ongoing transactions (e.g. N1
procedure) for certain UE(s), AMF forwards the UE context(s) to the
target AMF upon completion of an ongoing transaction.

\- The AMF deregister itself from NRF indicating due to AMF planned
removal.

NOTE 1: It is assumed that the UE contexts from the old AMF include all
event subscriptions with peer CP NFs.

NOTE 2: Before removal of AMF the overload control mechanism can be used
to reduce the amount of ongoing transaction.

An AMF shall be able to instruct the 5G-AN that it will be unavailable
for processing transactions by including GUAMI(s) configured on this AMF
and its corresponding target AMF(s). The target AMF shall be able to
update the 5G-AN that the UE(s) served by the old GUAMI(s) are now
served by target AMF. The target AMF provides the old GUAMI value that
the 5G-AN can use to locate UE contexts served by the old AMF. Upon
receipt of the indication that an old AMF is unavailable, 5G-AN shall
take the following action:

\- 5G-AN should mark this AMF as unavailable and not consider the AMF
for selection for subsequent N2 transactions until 5G-AN learns that it
is available (e.g. as part of discovery results or by configuration).
The associated GUAMIs are marked as unavailable.

\- During NGAP Setup, the AMF may include an additional indicator that
the AMF will rebind or release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding on per UE-basis.
If that indicator is included and the 5G-AN supports timer mechanism,
the 5G-AN starts a timer to control the release of NGAP
UE-TNLA-binding(s). For the duration of the timer or until the AMF
releases or re-binds the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding, the AN does not select a
new AMF for subsequent transactions. Upon timer expiry, the 5G-AN
releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s) with the corresponding AMF for the
respective UE(s), for subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN uses GUAMI which
points to the target AMF that replaced the old unavailable AMF, to
forward the N2 message to the corresponding target AMF(s).

NOTE 3: For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, after indicating that the AMF
is unavailable for processing UE transactions and including an indicator
that the AMF releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding on a per UE-basis, the
AMF can either trigger a re-binding of the NGAP UE associations to an
available TNLA on a different AMF within the same AMF set or use the
NGAP UE-TNLA-binding per UE release procedure defined in TS 23.502 \[3\]
to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding on a per UE-basis while requesting
the AN to maintain N3 (user plane connectivity) and UE context
information.

NOTE 4: The support and the use of timer mechanism in 5G-AN is up to
implementation.

If the instruction does not include the indicator, for UE(s) in
CM-CONNECTED state, 5G-AN considers this as a request to release the
NGAP UE UE-TNLA-binding(s) with the corresponding AMF for the respective
UE(s) while maintaining N3 (user plane connectivity) and UE context
information. For subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN uses GUAMI based
resolution which points to the target AMF that replaced the old
unavailable AMF, to forward the N2 message to the corresponding target
AMF(s).

\- For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when it subsequently returns from CM-IDLE
state and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a 5G S-TMSI or
GUAMI, based resolution the 5G-AN uses 5G S-TMSI or GUAMI which points
to the target AMF that has replaced the old unavailable AMF and, the
5G-AN forwards N2 message.

An AMF shall be able to instruct other peer CP NFs, subscribed to
receive such a notification, that it will be unavailable for processing
transactions by including GUAMI(s) configured on this AMF and its
corresponding target AMF(s). The target AMF shall update the CP NF that
the old GUAMI(s) is now served by target AMF. The old AMF provides the
old GUAMI value to target AMF and the target AMF can use to locate UE
contexts served by the old AMF. If the CP NFs register with NRF for AMF
unavailable notification, then the NRF shall be able to notify the
subscribed NFs to receive such a notification (along with the
corresponding target AMF(s)) that AMF identified by GUAMI(s) will be
unavailable for processing transactions. Upon receipt of the
notification that an AMF is unavailable, the other CP NFs shall take the
following action:

\- Mark this AMF and its associated GUAMI(s) as unavailable while not
changing the status of UE(s) associated to this AMF (UE(s) previously
served by the corresponding AMF still remain registered in the network),
and AMF Set information.

\- For the UE(s) that were associated to the corresponding AMF, when the
peer CP NF needs to initiate a transaction towards the AMF that is
marked unavailable and the old unavailable AMF was replaced by the
target AMF, CP NF should forward the transaction together with the old
GUAMI to the target AMF(s). If CP NF needs to send a notification to new
AMF which is associated with a subscription from the old AMF, the CP NF
shall exchange the old AMF information embedded in the Notification
Address with the new AMF information, and use that Notification Address
for subsequent communication.

NOTE 5: If the CP NF does not subscribe to receive AMF unavailable
notification (either directly with the AMF or via NRF), the CP NF may
attempt forwarding the transaction towards the old AMF and detect that
the AMF is unavailable after certain number of attempts. When it detects
unavailable, it marks the AMF and its associated GUAMI(s) as
unavailable.

The following actions should be performed by the target AMF:

\- To allow AMF process ongoing transactions for some UE(s) even after
it notifies unavailable status to the target AMF, the target AMF keeps
the association of the old GUAMI(s) and the old AMF for a configured
time. During that configured period, if target AMF receives the
transaction from the peer CP NFs and cannot locate UE context, it
rejects the transaction with old AMF name based on that association, and
the indicated AMF is only used for the ongoing transaction. The peer CP
NFs resend the transaction to the indicated AMF only for the ongoing
transaction. For subsequent transactions, peer CP NFs should use the
target AMF. When the timer is expired, the target AMF deletes that
association information.

\- When there is a transaction with the UE the target AMF uses SUPI,
5G-GUTI or AMF UE NGAP ID to locate UE contexts and processes the UE
transactions accordingly and updates the 5G-GUTI towards the UE, if
necessary. For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, it may also update the NGAP
UE association with a new AMF UE NGAP ID towards the 5G-AN and replace
the GUAMI in the UE context stored at the 5G-AN with the new GUAMI
associated with the newly selected AMF if the 5G-GUTI has been updated.
The AMF also informs the NG-RAN of the new UE Identity Index Value
(derived from the new 5G-GUTI).

\- Target AMF shall not use old GUAMI to allocate 5G-GUTI for UE(s) that
are being served by Target AMF.

#### 5.21.2.3 Procedure for AMF Auto-recovery

In order to try and handle AMF failure in a graceful manner (i.e.
without impacting the UE), AMF can either back up the UE contexts in
UDSF, or per GUAMI granularity in other AMFs (serving as backup AMF for
the indicated GUAMI).

NOTE 1: Frequency of backup is left to implementation.

For deployments without UDSF, for each GUAMI the backup AMF information
(in association to the GUAMI) is configured in the AMF. The AMF sends
this information to 5G-AN and other CP NFs during the N2 setup procedure
or the first (per NF) interaction with other CP NFs.

In the case that an AMF fails and the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs detect that the
AMF has failed, or the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs receives notification from
another AMF in the same AMF set that this AMF has failed, following
actions are taken:

\- The OAM deregister the AMF from NRF indicating due to AMF failure.

\- 5G-AN marks this AMF as failed and not consider the AMF for selection
until explicitly notified.

\- For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, 5G-AN considers failure detection or
failure notification as a trigger to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s)
with the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s) while maintaining N3
(user plane connectivity) and other UE context information. For
subsequent N2 message, if the backup AMF information of the
corresponding failed AMF is not available the 5G-AN should select a
different AMF (as in clause 6.3.5) from the same AMF set when the
subsequent N2 message needs to be sent for the UE(s). If no other AMF
from the AMF set is available, then it can select an AMF (implementation
dependent) from the same AMF Region as in clause 6.3.5. If backup AMF
information of the corresponding failed AMF is available, the 5G-AN
forwards the N2 message to the backup AMF.

NOTE 2: One AMF in the AMF set may be configured to send this failure
notification message.

\- For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when it subsequently returns from CM-IDLE
state and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a S-TMSI or
GUAMI pointing to an AMF that is marked failed, if the backup AMF
information of the corresponding failed AMF is not available the 5G-AN
should select a different AMF from the same AMF set and forward the
initial NAS message. If no other AMF from the AMF set is available, then
it can select an AMF (implementation dependent) from the same AMF Region
as in clause 6.3.5. If backup AMF information of the corresponding
failed AMF is available, the 5G-AN forwards the N2 message to the backup
AMF.

\- Peer CP NFs consider this AMF as unavailable while retaining the UE
context.

\- For the UE(s) that were associated to the corresponding AMF, when the
peer CP NF needs to initiate a transaction towards the AMF, if backup
AMF information of the corresponding failed AMF is not available, CP NF
should select another AMF from the same AMF set and forward the
transaction together with the old GUAMI. If neither the backup AMF nor
any other AMF from the AMF set is available, then CP NF can select an
AMF from the same AMF Region as in clause 6.3.5. If backup AMF
information of the corresponding failed AMF is available, the CP NF
forwards transaction to the backup AMF. If CP NF needs to send a
notification to new AMF which is associated with a subscription from the
old AMF, the CP NF shall exchange the old AMF information embedded in
the Notification Address with the new AMF information, and use that
Notification Address for subsequent communication.

\- When the 5G-AN or CP NFs need to select a different AMF from the same
AMF set,

\- For deployments with UDSF, any AMF from the same AMF set can be
selected.

\- For deployments without UDSF, the backup AMF is determined based on
the GUAMI of the failed AMF.

Following actions should be taken by the newly selected AMF:

\- For deployments with UDSF, when there is a transaction with the UE
the newly selected AMF retrieves the UE context from the UDSF using
SUPI, 5G-GUTI or AMF UE NGAP ID and it processes the UE message
accordingly and updates the 5G-GUTI towards the UE, if necessary.

\- For deployments without UDSF, backup AMF (the newly selected AMF),
based on the failure detection of the old AMF, instructs peer CP NFs and
5G-AN that the UE contexts corresponding to the GUAMI of the failed AMF
is now served by this newly selected AMF. The backup AMF shall not use
old GUAMI to allocate 5G-GUTI for UE(s) that are being served by Target
AMF. The backup AMF uses the GUAMI to locate the respective UE
Context(s).

\- When there is a transaction with the UE, the new AMF updates the peer
NFs (that subscribed to receive AMF unavailability notification from old
AMF) with the new AMF information.

\- If the new AMF is aware of a different AMF serving the UE (by
implementation specific means) it redirects the uplink N2 signalling to
that AMF, or reject the transaction from the peer CP NFs with a cause to
indicate that new AMF has been selected. The peer CP NFs may wait for
the update from the new AMF and resend the transaction to the new AMF.

NOTE 3: This bullet above addresses situations where 5G-AN node selects
an AMF and other CP NFs select an AMF for the UE concurrently. It also
addresses the situation where CP NFs select an AMF for the UE
concurrently.

NOTE 4: It is assumed that the UE contexts from the old AMF include all
event subscriptions with peer CP NFs.

\- If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the new AMF does not have access to
the UE context, the new AMF selects one available AMF from the old AMF
set as described in clause 6.3.5. The selected AMF retrieves the UE
context from the UDSF and provides the UE context to the new AMF. If the
new AMF doesn\'t receive the UE context then the AMF may force the UE to
perform Initial Registration.

\- If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the new AMF may also update the
NGAP UE association with a new AMF UE NGAP ID towards the 5G-AN and
replace the GUAMI in the UE context stored at the 5G-AN with the new
GUAMI associated with the newly selected AMF if the 5G-GUTI has been
updated.

NOTE 5: The above N2 TNL association selection and AMF management is
applied to the selected PLMN.

### 5.21.3 Network Reliability support with Sets

#### 5.21.3.1 General

A Network Function instance can be deployed such that several network
function instances are present within an NF Set to provide distribution,
redundancy and scalability together as a Set of NF instances. The same
is also supported for NF Services. This can be achieved when the
equivalent NFs and NF Services share the same context data or by Network
Function/NF Service Context Transfer procedures as specified in
clause 4.26 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE: A NF can be replaced by an alternative NF within the same NF Set
in the case of scenarios such as failure, load balancing, load
re-balancing.

Such a network reliability design shall work in both communication
modes, i.e. Direct Communication and Indirect Communication. In the
Direct Communication mode, the NF Service consumer is involved in the
reliability related procedures. In Indirect Communication mode, the SCP
is involved in the reliability related procedures.

#### 5.21.3.2 NF Set and NF Service Set

Equivalent Control Plane NFs may be grouped into NF Sets, e.g. several
SMF instances are grouped into an SMF Set. NFs within a NF Set are
interchangeable because they share the same context data, and may be
deployed in different locations, e.g. different data centres.

In the case of SMF, multiple instances of SMFs within an SMF Set need to
be connected to the same UPF:

\- If the N4 association is established between a SMF instance and an
UPF, each N4 association is only managed by the related SMF instance.

\- If only one N4 association is established between a SMF Set and an
UPF, any SMF in the SMF Set should be able to manage the N4 association
with the UPF.

Furthermore, for a given UE and PDU Session any SMF in the SMF Set
should be able to control the N4 session with the UPF (however, at any
given time, only one SMF in the SMF Set will control the UPF for a given
UE\'s PDU Session).

A Control Plane NF is composed of one or multiple NF Services. Within a
NF a NF service may have multiple instances. These multiple NF Service
instances can be grouped into NF Service Set if they are interchangeable
with each other because they share the same context data.

NOTE: The actual mapping of instances to a given Set is up to
deployment.

#### 5.21.3.3 Reliability of NF instances within the same NF Set

The NF producer instance is the NF instance which host the NF Service
Producer. When the NF producer instance is not available, another NF
producer instance within the same NF Set is selected.

For Direct Communication mode, the NF Service consumer may subscribe to
status change notifications of NF instance from the NRF. If the NF
Service consumer is notified by the NRF or detects by itself (e.g.
request is not responded) that the NF producer instance is not available
anymore, another available NF producer instance within the same NF Set
is selected by the NF Service consumer.

For Indirect Communication mode, the SCP or NF Service consumer may
subscribe to status change notifications of NF instance from the NRF and
selects another NF producer instance within the same NF Set if the
original NF producer instance serving the UE is not available anymore.

NOTE: It is up to the implementation on how the SCP knows a NF producer
instance is not available anymore.

#### 5.21.3.4 Reliability of NF Services

When multiple NF Service instances within a NF Service Set are exposed
to the NF Service consumer or SCP and the failure of NF Service instance
is detected or notified by the NRF, i.e. it is not available anymore,
the NF Service consumer or SCP selects another NF Service instance of
the same NF Service Set within the NF instance, if available. Otherwise
the NF Service consumer or SCP selects a different NF instance within
the same NF Set.

NOTE: The NF Producer instance can change the NF Service instance in the
response to the service request.

When multiple NF Service instances within a NF Service Set are exposed
to the NF Service consumer or SCP as a single NF Service, the
reliability, i.e. the selection of an alternative NF Service instance is
handled within the NF instance.

### 5.21.4 Network Function/NF Service Context Transfer

#### 5.21.4.1 General

Network Function/NF Service Context Transfer Procedures allow transfer
of Service Context of a NF/NF Service from a Source NF/NF Service
Instance to the Target NF/NF Service Instance e.g. before the Source
NF/NF Service can gracefully close its NF/NF Service. Service Context
Transfer procedures are supported as specified in clause 4.26 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

Source NF / OA&M system determines when Source NF needs to transfer UE
contexts to an NF in another NF set. Source NF should initiate this only
for UE(s) that are not active in order to limit and avoid impacting
services offered to corresponding UE(s).

## 5.22 System Enablers for priority mechanism

### 5.22.1 General

The 5GS and the 5G QoS model allow classification and differentiation of
specific services such as listed in clause 5.16, based on
subscription-related and invocation-related priority mechanisms. These
mechanisms provide abilities such as invoking, modifying, maintaining,
and releasing QoS Flows with priority, and delivering QoS Flow packets
according to the QoS characteristics under network congestion
conditions.

Subscription-related Priority Mechanisms include the ability to
prioritize flows based on subscription information, including the
prioritization of RRC Connection Establishment based on Unified Access
Control mechanisms and the establishment of prioritized QoS Flows.

Invocation-related Priority Mechanisms include the ability for the
service layer to request/invoke the activation of prioritized QoS Flows
through an interaction over Rx/N5 and packet detection in the UPF.

QoS Mechanisms applied to established QoS Flows include the ability to
fulfil the QoS characteristics of QoS Flows through preservation of
differentiated treatment for prioritized QoS Flow and resource
distribution prioritization.

Messages associated with priority services that are exchanged over
service-based interfaces may include a Message Priority header to
indicate priority information, as specified in TS 23.502 \[3\] and
TS 29.500 \[49\].

In addition, the separation of concerns between the service
classification provided by the core network through the association of
Service Data Flows to QoS, and the enforcing of QoS differentiation in
(R)AN through the association of QoS Flows to Data Radio bearers,
supports the prioritization of QoS Flows when a limitation of the
available data radio bearers occurs.

In addition, it also includes the ability for the service layer to
provide instructions on how to perform pre-emption of media flows with
the same priority assigned through an interaction over Rx as defined in
TS 23.503 \[45\].

### 5.22.2 Subscription-related Priority Mechanisms

Subscription-related mechanisms which are always applied:

\- (R)AN: During initial Access Network Connection Establishment, the
Establishment Cause is set to indicate that special treatment is to be
applied by the (R)AN in the radio resource allocation as specified in
clause 5.2 for 3GPP access.

\- **UDM:** As defined in clause 5.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], the UE
subscription data in the UDM contains an MPS subscription indication
(i.e. MPS priority) and an MCX subscription indication (i.e. MCX
priority) for the UE that has subscription to MPS and MCX, respectively.
The MPS priority and the MCX priority, if available, are provided to the
AMF via the Registration or the UE Configuration Update procedure as
defined in clause 4.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- **AMF:** Following Access Network Connection Establishment, the
receipt of the designated Establishment Cause (i.e. high priority
access) by the AMF will result in priority handling of the \"Initial UE
Message\" received as part of the Registration procedures of
clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. If the AMF did not receive a designated
Establishment Cause (i.e. high priority access), but when the AMF
determines that there is a MPS priority (or MCX priority) in the UDM for
that UE, the AMF shall provide priority handling for that UE at that
time and shall provide the MPS priority (or MCX priority) to the UE via
the Registration or the UE Configuration Update procedure, as defined in
clause 4.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. In addition, certain exemptions to
Control Plane Congestion and Overload Control are provided as specified
in clause 5.19.

Subscription-related mechanisms which are conditionally applied:

\- **UE:** When barring control parameters are broadcast by the RAN,
access barring based on Access Identity(es) configured in the USIM
and/or an Access Category is applied prior to an initial upstream
transmission for the UE which provides a mechanism to limit
transmissions from UEs categorized as non-prioritized, while allowing
transmissions from UEs categorized as prioritized (such as MPS
subscribed UEs), during the RRC Connection Establishment procedure as
specified in clause 5.2.

\- **UDM:** One or more ARP priority levels are assigned for prioritized
or critical services. The ARP of the prioritized QoS Flows for each DN
is set to an appropriate ARP priority level. The 5QI is from the
standard value range as specified in clause 5.7.2.7. In addition,
Priority Level may be configured for the standardized 5QIs, and if
configured, it overwrites the default value specified in the QoS
characteristics Table 5.7.4-1.

\- **PCF:** The \"IMS Signalling Priority\" information is set for the
subscriber in the UDM, and the PCF modifies the ARP of the QoS Flow used
for IMS signalling, for each DN which supports prioritized services
leveraging on IMS signalling, to an appropriate ARP priority level
assigned for that service.

### 5.22.3 Invocation-related Priority Mechanisms

The generic mechanisms used based on invocation-related Priority
Mechanisms for prioritised services are based an interaction with an
Application Function and between the Application Function and the PCF
over Rx/N5 interface.

These mechanisms apply to mobile originated as well as mobile terminated
SIP call/sessions (clause 5.21 of TS 23.228 \[15\]) and Priority PDU
connectivity services including MPS for Data Transport Service.

NOTE 1: Clause 5.21 of TS 23.228 \[15\] is applicable to 5GS, with the
understanding that the term PCRF corresponds to PCF in the 5GS.

Invocation-related mechanisms for Mobile Originations e.g. via SIP/IMS:

\- PCF: When an indication for a session arrives over the Rx/N5
Interface and the UE does not have priority for the signalling QoS Flow,
the PCF derives the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated QoS
characteristics as appropriate, of the QoS Flow for Signalling as per
Service Provider policy as specified in clause 6.1.3.11 of
TS 23.503 \[45\].

\- PCF: For sessions such as MPS, when establishing or modifying a QoS
Flow for media as part of the session origination procedure, the PCF
selects the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated QoS characteristics
as appropriate, to provide priority treatment to the QoS Flow(s).

\- PCF: When all active sessions to a particular DN are released, and
the UE is not configured for priority treatment to that particular PDU
Session for a DN, the PCF will downgrade the IMS Signalling QoS Flows
from appropriate settings of the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated
QoS characteristics as appropriate, to those entitled by the UE based on
subscription.

Invocation-related mechanisms for Mobile Terminations e.g. via SIP/IMS:

\- PCF: When an indication for a session arrives over the Rx/N5
Interface, mechanisms as described above for Mobile Originations are
applied.

\- UPF: If an IP packet arrives at the UPF for a UE that is CM-IDLE, the
UPF sends a \"Data Notification\" including the information to identify
the QoS Flow for the DL data packet to the SMF, as specified in
clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- SMF: If a \" Data Notification\" message arrives at the SMF for a QoS
Flow associated with an ARP priority level value that is entitled for
priority use, delivery of priority indication during the Paging
procedure is provided by inclusion of the ARP in the N11 interface
\"N1N2MessageTransfer\" message, as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- AMF: If an \"N1N2MessageTransfer\" message arrives at the AMF
containing an ARP priority level value that is entitled for priority
use, the AMF handles the request with priority and includes the \"Paging
Priority\" IE in the N2 \"Paging\" message set to a value assigned to
indicate that there is an IP packet at the UPF entitled to priority
treatment, as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- SMF: For a UE that is not configured for priority treatment, upon
receiving the \"N7 Session Management Policy Modification\" message from
the PCF with an ARP priority level that is entitled for priority use,
the SMF sends an \"N1N2MessageTransfer\" to update the ARP for the
Signalling QoS Flows, as specified in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- AMF: Upon receiving the \"N1N2MessageTransfer\" message from the SMF
with an ARP priority level that is entitled for priority use, the AMF
updates the ARP for the Signalling QoS Flows, as specified in
clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- (R)AN: Inclusion of the \"Paging Priority\" in the N2 \"Paging\"
message triggers priority handling of paging in times of congestion at
the (R)AN as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Invocation-related mechanisms for the Priority PDU connectivity
services:

\- PCF: If the state of the Priority PDU connectivity services is
modified from disabled to enabled, the QoS Flow(s) controlled by the
Priority PDU connectivity services are established/modified to have the
service appropriate settings of the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus
associated QoS characteristics as appropriate, using the PDU Session
Modification procedure as specified in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- PCF: If the state of Priority PDU connectivity services is modified
from enabled to disabled, the QoS Flow(s) controlled by the Priority PDU
connectivity services are modified from Priority PDU connectivity
service appropriate settings of the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus
associated QoS characteristics as appropriate, to those entitled by the
UE as per subscription, using the PDU Session Modification procedure as
specified in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Invocation-related mechanisms for MPS for Data Transport Service:

\- MPS for Data Transport Service follows the same steps as those for
Priority PDU connectivity services. The QoS Flows that will be subject
to MPS for Data Transport Service are based on operator policy and
regulations by means of local PCF configuration.

NOTE 2: If no configuration is provided, MPS for Data Transport Service
applies to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.

### 5.22.4 QoS Mechanisms applied to established QoS Flows

Mechanisms applied to established QoS Flows:

\- (R)AN: QoS Flows requested in the Xn \"Handover Request\" or N2
\"Handover Request\" which are marked as entitled to priority by virtue
of inclusion of an ARP value from the set allocated by the Service
Provider for prioritised services are given priority over requests for
QoS Flows which do not include an ARP from the set as specified in
clause 4.9 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- SMF: Congestion management procedures in the SMF will provide
priority to QoS Flows established for sessions during periods of extreme
overload. Prioritised services are exempt from any session management
congestion controls. See clause 5.19.

\- AMF: Congestion management procedures in the AMF will provide
priority to any Mobility Management procedures required for the
prioritised services during periods of extreme overload. Prioritised
services are exempt from any Mobility Management congestion controls.
See clause 5.19.5.

\- QoS Flows whose ARP parameter is from the set allocated by the
Service Provider for prioritised services\' use shall be exempt from
release during QoS Flow load rebalancing.

\- (R)AN, UPF: IMS Signalling Packets associated with prioritised
services\' use are handled with priority. Specifically, during times of
severe congestion when it is necessary to drop packets on the IMS
Signalling QoS Flow, or QoS Flow supporting MPS for Data Transport
Service signalling, to ensure network stability, these FEs shall drop
packets not associated with priority signalling such as MPS or Mission
Critical services before packets associated with priority signalling.
See clauses 5.16.5 and 5.16.6.

\- (R)AN, UPF: During times of severe congestion when it is necessary to
drop packets on a media QoS Flow to ensure network stability, these FEs
shall drop packets not associated with priority sessions such as MPS or
Mission Critical services before packets associated with priority
sessions. See clauses 5.16.5 and 5.16.6.

## 5.23 Supporting for Asynchronous Type Communication

Asynchronous type communication (ATC) enables 5GC to delay synchronizing
UE context with the UE, so as to achieve an efficient signalling
overhead and increase system capacity. The support of ATC is optional
for the AMF.

5GC supports asynchronous type communication with the following
functionality:

\- Capability to store the UE context based on the received message, and
synchronize the UE context with the involved network functions or UE
later;

For network function (e.g. PCF, UDM, etc.) triggered signalling
procedure (e.g. network triggered Service Request procedure, network
triggered PDU Session Modification procedure, etc.), if the UE CM state
in the AMF is CM-IDLE state and the requesting network function
indicates to the AMF the ATC is allowed for the signalling, if the AMF
supports the ATC feature, the AMF may update and store the UE context
based on the received message without paging UE immediately. When the UE
CM state in the AMF enters CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF forwards N1 and
N2 message to synchronize the UE context with the (R)AN and/or the UE.

If the originating NF does not require immediate delivery, it may
indicate that the AMF is allowed to use ATC.

NOTE: Pre-Rel-17 AMF implementation cannot decode the indication that
ATC is allowed.

## 5.24 3GPP PS Data Off

This feature, when activated by the user, prevents traffic via 3GPP
access of all IP packets, Unstructured and Ethernet data except for
those related to 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. The 3GPP PS Data Off
Exempt Services are a set of operator services, defined in
TS 22.011 \[25\] and TS 23.221 \[23\], that are the only allowed
services when the 3GPP PS Data Off feature has been activated by the
user. The 5GC shall support 3GPP PS Data Off operation in both
non-roaming and roaming scenarios.

UEs may be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services and the list(s) are provided to the UEs by HPLMN via Device
Management or UICC provisioning. When the UE is configured with two
lists, one list is valid for the UEs camping in the home PLMN and the
other list is valid for any VPLMN the UE is roaming in. When the UE is
configured with a single list, without an indication to which PLMNs the
list is applicable, then this list is valid for the home PLMN and any
PLMN the UE is roaming in.

NOTE 1: The operator needs to ensure coordinated list(s) of 3GPP Data
Off Exempt Services provisioned in the UE and configured in the network.

The UE reports its 3GPP PS Data Off status in PCO (Protocol
Configuration Option) to (H-)SMF during UE requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure for establishment of a PDU Session associated
with 3GPP access and/or non-3GPP access. The UE does not need to report
PS Data Off status during the PDU Session Establishment procedure for
handover of the PDU Session between 3GPP access and non 3GPP access if
3GPP PS Data Off status is not changed since the last report. The PS
Data Off status for a PDU Session does not affect data transfer over
non-3GPP access.

If 3GPP PS Data Off is activated, the UE prevents the sending of uplink
IP packets, Unstructured and Ethernet data except for those related to
3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services, based on the pre-configured list(s) of
Data Off Exempt Services.

If 3GPP PS Data Off is activated for a UE with MA PDU Sessions
established through the ATSSS feature (see clause 5.32), the data
transferred over the non-3GPP access of the MA PDU sessions are
unaffected, which is ensured by the policy for ATSSS Control as
specified in clause 5.32.3.

The UE shall immediately report a change of its 3GPP PS Data Off status
in PCO by using UE requested PDU Session Modification procedure. This
also applies to the scenario of inter-RAT mobility to NG-RAN and to
scenarios where the 3GPP PS Data Off status is changed when the session
management back-off timer is running as specified in clause 5.19.7.3 and
clause 5.19.7.4. For UEs in Non-Allowed Area (or not in Allowed Area) as
specified in clause 5.3.4.1, the UE shall also immediately report a
change of its 3GPP PS Data Off status for the PDU Session. For UEs
moving out of LADN area and the PDU Session is still maintained as
specified in clause 5.6.5, the UE shall also immediately report a change
of its 3GPP PS Data Off status for the PDU Session.

The additional behaviour of the SMF for 3GPP PS Data Off is controlled
by local configuration or policy from the PCF as defined in
TS 23.503 \[45\].

NOTE 2: For the PDU Session used for IMS services, the 3GPP Data Off
Exempt Services are enforced in the IMS domain as specified
TS 23.228 \[15\]. Policies configured in the (H-)SMF/PCF need to ensure
those services are always allowed when the 3GPP Data Off status of the
UE is set to \"activated\".

## 5.25 Support of OAM Features

### 5.25.1 Support of Tracing: Signalling Based Activation/Deactivation of Tracing

5GS supports tracing as described in TS 32.421 \[66\]. 5GS support may
include subscriber tracing (tracing targeting a SUPI) or equipment
tracing (tracing targeting a PEI) but also other forms of tracing
further described in TS 32.421 \[66\].

NOTE 1: TS 23.501 / TS 23.502 \[3\] / TS 23.503 \[45\] only describe how
5GS signalling supports delivery of Trace Requirements about a UE
(Signalling Based Activation/Deactivation of Tracing). OAM delivery of
tracing requirements as well as the transfer of tracing results to one
or more Operations Systems are out of scope of these documents.

The content of Trace Requirements about a UE (e.g. trace reference,
address of the Trace Collection Entity, etc.) is defined in
TS 32.421 \[66\].

Trace Requirements about a UE may be configured in subscription data of
the UE and delivered together with other subscription data by the UDM
towards the AMF, the SMF and/or the SMSF.

The AMF propagates Trace Requirements about a UE received from the UDM
to network entities not retrieving subscription information from UDM,
i.e. to the 5G-AN, to the AUSF and to the PCF. The AMF also propagates
Trace Requirements to the SMF and to the SMSF. If the I-SMF or V-SMF is
needed for the PDU session, the AMF propagates Trace Requirements to the
I-SMF or V-SMF. The I-SMF or V-SMF also propagates Trace Requirements
received from the AMF to the I-UPF or V-UPF (over N4).

Trace Requirements about a UE may be sent by the AMF to the 5G-AN as
part of:

\- the N2 procedures used to move the UE from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED
or,

\- the N2 procedures to request a Hand-over from a target NG-RAN or,

\- a stand-alone dedicated N2 procedure when tracing is activated while
the UE is CM-CONNECTED.

Trace Requirements about a UE sent to a 5G-AN shall not contain
information on the SUPI or on the PEI of the UE. Trace Requirements are
directly sent from Source to Target NG-RAN in the case of Xn Hand-Over.

The SMF propagates Trace Requirements about a UE received from the UDM
to the UPF (over N4) and to the PCF. The SMF provides Trace Requirements
to the PCF when it has selected a different PCF than the one received
from the AMF.

Once the SMF or the SMSF has received subscription data, Trace
Requirements received from UDM supersede Trace requirements received
from the AMF. Trace Requirements are exchanged on N26 between the AMF
and the MME.

### 5.25.2 Support of OAM-based 5G VN group management

5GS supports 5G LAN-type service as defined in clause 5.29. 5G LAN-type
service includes the 5G VN group management that can be configured by a
network administrator.

The parameters for 5G VN group is defined in clause 5.29.

The 5G VN group parameters about a UE may be configured in subscription
data of the UE and delivered together with other subscription data by
the UDM towards the AMF and SMF.

## 5.26 Configuration Transfer Procedure

The purpose of the Configuration Transfer is to enable the transfer of
information between two RAN nodes at any time via NG interface and the
Core Network. An example of application is to exchange the RAN node\'s
IP addresses in order to be able to use Xn interface between the NG-RAN
node for Self-Optimised Networks (SON), as specified in
TS 38.413 \[34\].

### 5.26.1 Architecture Principles for Configuration Transfer

Configuration Transfer between two RAN node provides a generic mechanism
for the exchange of information between applications belonging to the
RAN nodes.

In order to make the information transparent for the Core Network, the
information is included in a transparent container that includes source
and target RAN node addresses, which allows the Core Network nodes to
route the messages. The mechanism is depicted in figure 5.26 1.

![](media/image68.emf)

Figure 5.26-1: inter NG-RAN Configuration Transfer basic network
architecture

The NG-RAN transparent containers are transferred from the source NG-RAN
node to the destination NG-RAN node by use of Configuration Transfer
messages.

A Configuration Transfer message is used from the NG-RAN node to the AMF
over N2 interface, a AMF Configuration Transfer message is used from the
AMF to the NG-RAN over N2 interface, and a Configuration Transfer Tunnel
message is used to tunnel the transparent container from a source AMF to
a target AMF over the N14 interface.

Each Configuration Transfer message carrying the transparent container
is routed and relayed independently by the core network node(s).

### 5.26.2 Addressing, routing and relaying

#### 5.26.2.1 Addressing

All the Configuration Transfer messages contain the addresses of the
source and destination RAN nodes. An NG-RAN node is addressed by the
Target NG-RAN node identifier.

#### 5.26.2.2 Routing

The following description applies to all the Configuration Transfer
messages used for the exchange of the transparent container.

The source RAN node sends a message to its core network node including
the source and destination addresses. The AMF uses the destination
address to route the message to the correct AMF via the N14 interface.

The AMF connected to the destination RAN node decides which RAN node to
send the message to, based on the destination address.

#### 5.26.2.3 Relaying

The AMF performs relaying between N2 and N14 messages as described in
TS 38.413 \[34\], TS 29.518 \[71\].

## 5.27 Enablers for Time Sensitive Communications and Time Synchronization

### 5.27.0 General

This clause describes 5G System features that can be used independently
or in combination to enable time-sensitive communication and time
synchronization:

\- Delay-critical GBR;

\- A hold and forward mechanism to schedule traffic as defined in
IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 \[98\] for Ethernet PDU Sessions in DS-TT and NW-TT
(see clause 5.27.4) to de-jitter flows that have traversed the 5G System
if the 5G System is to participate transparently as a bridge in a TSN
network;

\- TSC Assistance Information: describes TSC flow traffic
characteristics as described in clause 5.27.2 that may be provided
optionally for use by the gNB, to allow more efficiently schedule radio
resources for periodic traffic and applies to PDU Session type Ethernet
and IP.

\- Time Synchronization: describes how 5GS can operate as a PTP Relay
(IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\]), as a Boundary Clock or as Transparent Clock
(IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]) for PDU Session type Ethernet and IP.

The 5G System integration as a bridge in an IEEE 802.1 TSN network as
described in clause 5.28 can make use of all features listed above.

To support any of the above features to enable time-sensitive
communication and time synchronization, during the PDU Session
establishment, the UE shall request to establish a PDU Session as an
always-on PDU Session, and the PDU Sessions are established as Always-on
PDU session as described in clause 5.6.13. In this release of the
specification, to use any of the above features to enable time-sensitive
communication and time synchronization:

\- Home Routed PDU Sessions are not supported;

\- PDU Sessions are supported only for SSC mode 1;

\- Service continuity is not supported when the UE moves from 5GS to EPS
.i.e. interworking with EPS is not supported for a PDU Session for time
synchronization or TSC.

### 5.27.1 Time Synchronization

#### 5.27.1.1 General

For supporting time synchronization service, the 5GS is configured to
operate in one or multiple PTP instances and to operate in one of the
following modes (if supported) for each PTP instance:

1\) as time-aware system as described in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\],

2\) as Boundary Clock as described in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], provisioned
by the profiles supported by this 3GPP specification including SMPTE
Profile for Use of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] Precision Time Protocol in
Professional Broadcast Applications ST 2059-2:2015 \[127\];

NOTE 1: Via proper configuration of the IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] data set
members, the 5G internal system clock can become the time source for the
PTP grandmaster function for the connected networks in the case of mode
1 and mode 2.

NOTE 2: In some cases where the 5G internal system clock is the time
source for the PTP grandmaster function for the connected networks, it
might not be required for the UE to receive gPTP or PTP messages over
user plane. The UE and DS-TT uses the 5G timing information and
generates the necessary gPTP or PTP message for the end station, if
needed (this is implementation specific).

3\) as peer-to-peer Transparent Clock as described in
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], provisioned by the profiles supported by this
3GPP specification including SMPTE Profile for Use of IEEE Std 1588
Precision Time Protocol in Professional Broadcast Applications
ST 2059-2:2015 \[127\]; or

4\) as end-to-end Transparent Clock as described in
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], provisioned by the profiles supported by this
3GPP specification including SMPTE Profile for Use of IEEE Std 1588
Precision Time Protocol in Professional Broadcast Applications
ST 2059-2:2015 \[127\].

NOTE 3: When the GM is external, the operation of 5GS as Boundary Clock
assumes that profiles that are supported by the 5GS allows the exemption
specified in clauses 9.5.9 and 9.5.10 of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] where the
originTimestamp (or preciseOriginTimestamp in case of two-step
operation) is not required to be updated with the
syncEventEgressTimestamp (and a Local PTP Clock locked to the external
GM). As described in clause 5.27.1.2.2, only correctionField is updated
with the 5GS residence time and link delay, in a similar operation as
specified by IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\].

The configuration of the time synchronization service in 5GS for option
1 by TSN AF and CNC is described in clause 5.28.3, and for options 1-4
by AF/NEF and TSCTSF in clause 5.27.1.8 and clause 5.28.3.

The 5GS shall be modelled as an IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] or
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] compliant entity based on the above configuration.

NOTE 4: This release of the specification does not support the PTP
management mechanism or PTP management messages as described in
clause 15 in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

The DS-TT and NW-TT at the edge of the 5G system may support the
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] or other IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] profiles\'
operations respective to the configured mode of operation. The UE, gNB,
UPF, NW-TT and DS- TTs are synchronized with the 5G GM (i.e. the 5G
internal system clock) which shall serve to keep these network elements
synchronized. The TTs located at the edge of 5G system fulfil some
functions related to IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] and may fulfil some
functions related to IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], e.g. (g)PTP support and
timestamping. Figure 5.27.1-1 illustrates the 5G and PTP grandmaster
(GM) clock distribution model via 5GS.

![](media/image69.emf)

Figure 5.27.1-1: 5G system is modelled as PTP instance for supporting
time synchronization

Figure 5.27.1-1 depicts the two synchronizations systems considered: the
5G Clock synchronization and the (g)PTP domain synchronization.

\- 5G Access Stratum-based Time Distribution: Used for NG RAN
synchronization and also distributed to the UE. The 5G Access
Stratum-based Time Distribution over the radio interface towards the UE
is specified in TS 38.331 \[28\]. This method may be used to either
further distribute the 5G timing to devices connected to a UE (using
implementation-specific means) or to support the operation of the
(g)PTP-based time distribution method.

\- (g)PTP-based Time Distribution: Provides timing among entities in a
(g)PTP domain. This process follows the applicable profiles of
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] or IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]. This method relies on
the 5G access stratum-based time distribution method to synchronize the
UE/DS-TT and on the 5GS time synchronization to synchronize the gNB
(which, in turn, may synchronize the DS-TT) and the NW-TT.

The gNB needs to be synchronized to the 5G GM clock.

The 5GS supports two methods for determining the grandmaster PTP
Instance and the time-synchronization spanning tree.

\- Method a), BMCA procedure.

\- Method b), local configuration.

This is further described in clause 5.27.1.6.

#### 5.27.1.2 Distribution of timing information

##### 5.27.1.2.1 Distribution of 5G internal system clock

The 5G internal system clock shall be made available to all user plane
nodes in the 5G system. The UPF and NW-TT may get the 5G internal system
clock via the underlying PTP compatible transport network with
mechanisms outside the scope of 3GPP. The 5G internal system clock shall
be made available to UE with signalling of time information related to
absolute timing of radio frames as described in TS 38.331 \[28\]. The 5G
internal system clock shall be made available to DS-TT by the UE.

##### 5.27.1.2.2 Distribution of grandmaster clock and time-stamping

##### 5.27.1.2.2.1 Distribution of gPTP Sync and Follow_Up messages {#distribution-of-gptp-sync-and-follow_up-messages .H6}

The mechanisms for distribution of TSN GM clock and time-stamping
described in this clause are according to IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\].

NOTE 1: It means Externally-observable behaviour of the 5GS bridge needs
to comply with IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\].

For downlink Time Synchronization, upon reception of a downlink gPTP
message from NW-TT port in Follower state, the NW-TT makes an ingress
timestamping (TSi) for each gPTP event (Sync) message and uses the
cumulative rateRatio received inside the gPTP message payload (carried
within Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_up message for
two-step operation) to calculate the link delay from the upstream TSN
node (gPTP entity connected to NW-TT) expressed in TSN GM time as
specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\]. NW-TT then calculates the new
cumulative rateRatio (i.e. the cumulative rateRatio of the 5GS) as
specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] and modifies the gPTP message
payload (carried within Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_up
message for two-step operation) as follows:

\- Adds the link delay from the upstream TSN node in TSN GM time to the
correction field.

\- Replaces the cumulative rateRatio received from the upstream TSN node
with the new cumulative rateRatio.

\- Adds TSi in the Suffix field of the gPTP packet as described in
clause H.2.

The UPF/NW-TT uses the ingress port number of the NW-TT, and
domainNumber and sdoId in the received gPTP message to assign the gPTP
message to a PTP instance in the NW-TT. If the NW-TT does not have a
matching PTP instance, the UPF/NW-TT discards the message. The UPF/NW-TT
then forwards the gPTP message from TSN network to the PTP ports in
DS-TT(s) in Leader state within this PTP instance via PDU sessions
terminating in this UPF that the UEs have established to the TSN
network. The UPF/NW-TT also forwards the gPTP message to the PTP ports
in NW-TT in Leader state within this PTP instance. All gPTP messages are
transmitted on a QoS Flow that complies with the residence time upper
bound requirement specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\].

NOTE 2: Leader and Follower terms in this specification maps to Master
and Slave terms respectively for (g)PTP time synchronization as
specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] and IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]. This
terminology can require update depending on the IEEE 1588 WG response to
SA WG2.

NOTE 3: The sum of the UE-DS-TT residence time and the PDB of the QoS
Flow needs to be lower than the residence time upper bound requirement
for a time-aware system specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] in the
following cases:

a\) If the PTP port in DS-TT is in Follower state and a PTP port in the
NW-TT is in Leader state; or

b\) a PTP port in DS-TT is in Leader state and a PTP port in NW-TT is in
Follower state.

NOTE 4: If the PTP port in DS-TT is in a Follower state, and a PTP port
in another DS-TT is in Leader state, then the sum of the residence time
for these two DS-TT ports and the PDB of the QoS flow of the two PDU
Sessions needs to be lower than the residence time upper bound
requirement for a time-aware system specified in
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\].

A UE receives the gPTP messages and forwards them to the DS-TT. The
DS-TT then creates egress timestamping (TSe) for the gPTP event (Sync)
messages for external TSN working domains. The difference between TSi
and TSe is considered as the calculated residence time spent within the
5G system for this gPTP message expressed in 5GS time. The DS-TT then
uses the rateRatio contained inside the gPTP message payload (carried
within Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_up message for
two-step operation) to convert the residence time spent within the 5GS
in TSN GM time and modifies the payload of the gPTP message that it
sends towards the downstream TSN node (gPTP entity connected to DS-TT)
as follows:

\- Adds the calculated residence time expressed in TSN GM time to the
correction field.

\- Removes Suffix field that contains TSi.

If the ingress DS-TT has indicated support of the
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] PTP profile as described in clause K.2.1 and
the network has configured a PTP instance with the
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] PTP profile for the ingress DS-TT, the ingress
DS-TT performs the following operations for received UL gPTP messages
for the PTP instance:

\- Adds the link delay from the upstream TSN node (gPTP entity connected
to DS-TT) in TSN GM time to the correction field.

\- Replaces the cumulative rateRatio received from the upstream TSN node
(gPTP entity connected to DS-TT) with the new cumulative rateRatio.

\- Adds TSi in the Suffix field of the gPTP packet.

The UE transparently forwards the gPTP message from DS-TT to the
UPF/NW-TT. If the ingress DS-TT port is in Passive state, the UPF/NW-TT
discards the gPTP messages. If the ingress DS-TT port is in Follower
state, the UPF/NW-TT forwards the gPTP messages as follows:

\- In the case of synchronizing end stations behind NW-TT, the egress
port is in UPF/NW-TT. For the received UL gPTP messages, the egress
UPF/NW-TT performs the following actions:

\- Adds the calculated residence time expressed in TSN GM to the
correction field.

\- Removes Suffix field that contains TSi.

\- In the case of synchronizing TSN end stations behind DS-TT, the
egress TT is DS-TT of the other UE, and the UPF/NW-TT uses the port
number of the ingress DS-TT, and domainNumber and sdoId in the received
gPTP message to assign the gPTP message to a PTP instance in the NW-TT.
If the NW-TT does not have a matching PTP instance, the UPF/NW-TT
discards the message. The UPF/NW-TT then forwards the received UL gPTP
message to the PTP ports in DS-TT(s) in Leader state within this PTP
instance. The egress DS-TT performs same actions as egress UPF/NW-TT in
previous case.

##### 5.27.1.2.2.2 Distribution of PTP Sync and Follow_Up messages {#distribution-of-ptp-sync-and-follow_up-messages .H6}

This clause applies if DS-TT and NW-TT support distribution of PTP Sync
and Follow_Up messages. PTP support by DS-TT and NW-TT may be determined
as described in clause K.2.1.

The mechanisms for distribution of PTP GM clock and time-stamping
described in this clause are according to IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] for
Transparent clock and for the case of Boundary clock when the GM is
external, where the originTimestamp (or preciseOriginTimestamp) is not
updated by the 5GS as described by the exemption in clause 5.27.1.1. If
the 5GS acts as the GM with a PTP instance type Boundary clock, then the
5GS updates the originTimestamp (or preciseOriginTimestamp in case of
two-step operation) with the 5GS internal clock, as described in
clause 5.27.1.7.

NOTE 1: This means externally-observable behaviour of the PTP instance
in 5GS needs to comply with IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

Upon reception of a PTP event message from the upstream PTP instance,
the ingress TT (i.e. NW-TT or DS-TT) makes an ingress timestamping (TSi)
for each PTP event (i.e. Sync) message.

The PTP port in the ingress TT measures the link delay from the upstream
PTP instance as described in clause H.4.

The PTP port in the ingress TT modifies the PTP message payload (carried
within Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_Up message for
two-step operation) as follows:

\- (if the PTP port in the ingress TT has measured the link delay) Adds
the measured link delay from the upstream PTP instance in PTP GM time to
the correction field.

\- (if the PTP port in the ingress TT has measured the link delay and
rateRatio is used) Replaces the cumulative rateRatio received from the
upstream PTP instance with the new cumulative rateRatio.

\- Adds TSi in the Suffix field of the PTP message as described in
clause H.2.

NOTE 2: If the 5GS is configured to use the Cumulative frequency
transfer method for synchronizing clocks as described in clause 16.10 in
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], i.e. when the cumulative rateRatio is measured,
then the PTP port in the ingress TT uses the cumulative rateRatio
received inside the PTP message payload (carried within Sync message for
one-step operation or Follow_Up message for two-step operation) to
correct the measured link delay to be expressed in PTP GM time as
specified in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]. The PTP port in the ingress TT then
calculates the new cumulative rateRatio (i.e. the cumulative rateRatio
of the 5GS) as specified in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

NOTE 3: If 5GS acts as an end-to-end Transparent Clock, since the
end-to-end Transparent Clock does not support peer-to-peer delay
mechanism, the residence time can be calculated with the residence time
spent within the 5GS in 5G GM time and if needed, with a correction
factor, for instance, as specified in Equation (6) of clause 12.2.2 of
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], this gives a residence time expressed in PTP GM
time that is used to update the correction field of the received PTP
Sync or Follow_Up message.

The PTP port in the ingress TT then forwards the PTP message to the
UPF/NW-TT. The UPF/NW-TT further distributes the PTP message as follows:

\- If the 5GS is configured to operate as Boundary Clock as described in
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], the UPF/NW-TT uses the port number of the ingress
DS-TT and domainNumber and sdoId in the received PTP message to assign
the PTP message to a PTP instance in the NW-TT. If the NW-TT does not
have a matching PTP instance, the UPF/NW-TT discards the message. The
UPF/NW-TT then regenerates the Sync and Follow_Up (for two-step
operation) messages based on the received Sync and Follow_Up messages
for the PTP ports in Leader state in NW-TT and DS-TT(s) within this PTP
instance. The NW-TT/UPF forwards the regenerated Sync and Follow_Up (for
two-step operation) messages to the Leader ports in NW-TT and the PDU
session(s) related to the Leader ports in the DS-TT(s) within this PTP
instance.

\- If the 5GS is configured to operate as a Transparent Clock as
described in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], the UPF/NW-TT uses the port number
of the ingress TT and domainNumber and sdoId in the received PTP message
to assign the PTP message to a PTP instance in the NW-TT. If the NW-TT
does not have a matching PTP instance, the UPF/NW-TT discards the
message. The UPF/NW-TT then forwards the received Sync messages to PTP
ports in DS-TT(s) within this PTP instance via corresponding PDU
Sessions terminating to this UPF, and to NW-TT ports within this PTP
instance, except toward the ingress PTP port in the ingress TT.

NOTE 4: If 5GS acts as a Transparent Clock, the 5GS does not maintain
the PTP port states; the ingress PTP messages received on a PTP Port are
retransmitted on all other PTP Ports of the Transparent Clock subject to
the rules of the underlying transport protocol.

NOTE 5: Due to the exemption described in clause 5.27.1.1, when the PTP
instance in 5GS is configured to operate as a Boundary Clock, the 5GS
does not need to synchronize its Local PTP Clock to the external PTP
grandmaster. The PTP instance in 5GS measures the link delay and
residence time and communicates these in a correction field. The
externally observable behaviour of 5GS still conforms to the
specifications for a Boundary Clock as described in
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

The PTP port in the egress TT then creates egress timestamping (TSe) for
the PTP event (i.e. Sync) messages for external PTP network. The
difference between TSi and TSe is considered as the calculated residence
time spent within the 5G system for this PTP message expressed in 5GS
time.

The PTP port in the egress TT then uses the rateRatio contained inside
the PTP message payload (if available, carried within Sync message for
one-step operation or Follow_Up message for two-step operation) to
convert the residence time spent within the 5GS in PTP GM time.

The PTP port in the egress TT modifies the payload of the PTP message
(Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_Up message for two-step
operation) that it sends towards the downstream PTP instance as follows:

\- Adds the calculated residence time to the correction field.

\- Removes Suffix field of the PTP message that contains TSi.

NOTE 6: If 5GS acts as an end-to-end Transparent Clock, since the
end-to-end Transparent Clock does not support peer-to-peer delay
mechanism, the residence time is calculated with the residence time
spent within the 5GS in 5G GM time and, if needed, corrected for
instance with the factor as specified in Equation (6) of clause 12.2.2
of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] to get it expressed in PTP GM time. The
residence time is used to update the correction field of the received
PTP event (e.g. Sync or Follow_Up) message.

#### 5.27.1.3 Support for multiple (g)PTP domains

This clause describes support for multiple domains for gPTP and PTP and
for GM clocks connected to DS-TT and NW-TT and only applies if DS-TT and
NW-TT support the related functionality. PTP support and support of gPTP
for GM clocks connected to DS-TT by DS-TT and NW-TT may be determined as
described in clause K.2.1.

Each (g)PTP domain sends its own (g)PTP messages. The (g)PTP message
carries a specific PTP \"domainNumber\" that indicates the time domain
they are referring to. The PTP port in ingress TT makes ingress
timestamping (TSi) for the (g)PTP event messages of all domains and
forwards the (g)PTP messages of all domains to the UPF/NW-TT that
further distributes the (g)PTP messages to the egress TTs as specified
in clause 5.27.1.2.2.

The PTP port in the egress TT receives the original PTP GM clock timing
information and the corresponding TSi via (g)PTP messages for one or
more (g)PTP domains. The PTP port in the egress TT then makes egress
timestamping (TSe) for the (g)PTP event messages for every (g)PTP
domain. Ingress and egress time stamping are based on the 5G system
clock at NW-TT and DS-TT.

NOTE 1: An end-station can select PTP timing information of interest
based on the \"domainNumber\" in the (g)PTP message.

The process described in clause 5.27.1.2.2 is thus repeated for each
(g)PTP domain between a DS-TT and the NW-TT it is connected to.

NOTE 2: If all (g)PTP domains can be made synchronous and the
synchronization can be provided by the 5G clock, the NW-TT or DS-TT(s)
generates the (g)PTP event messages of all domains using 5G clock as
described in clause 5.27.1.7.

NOTE 3: This Release of the specification supports multiple gPTP domains
as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\]. If a 5GS TSN bridge supports
stream gates and/or transmission gates as defined in
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], then they operate based on a single given gPTP
domain.

#### 5.27.1.4 DS-TT and NW-TT Time Synchronization functionality

This clause describes the support of Time Synchronization functionality
supported by the 5G System. Synchronization between UPF/NW-TT and NG-RAN
is outside scope of 3GPP.

DS-TT and NW-TT may support the following PTP instance types:

\- Boundary Clock as defined in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] as described in
clause 5.27.1.1;

\- End-to-End Transparent Clock as defined in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] as
described in clause 5.27.1.1;

\- Peer-to-Peer Transparent Clock as defined in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] as
described in clause 5.27.1.1;

\- PTP Relay instance as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\].

Editor\'s note: Support for external networks operating with
IEEE Std 1588-2008 \[107\] is for further study.

DS-TT and NW-TT may support the following transports for PTP:

\- IPv4 as defined in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] Annex C;

\- IPv6 as defined in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] Annex D;

IEEE Std 802.3 \[131\] (Ethernet) as defined in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]
Annex E.

For operation as a Boundary clock or as a Transparent Clock, DS-TT and
NW-TT may support the following path and link delay measurement methods:

\- Delay request-response mechanism as described in clause 11.3 of
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\];

\- Peer-to-peer delay mechanism as defined in clause 11.4 of
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

DS-TT and NW-TT may support acting as a PTP grandmaster, i.e. may
support generating (g)PTP Announce, Sync and Follow_Up messages. DS-TT
and NW-TT supporting (g)PTP shall support one or more PTP profiles as
described in clause 20.3 of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], i.e.:

\- Default PTP Profiles in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], Annex I;

\- IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] PTP profile for transport of timing as
defined in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] Annex F;

\- SMPTE Profile for Use of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] Precision Time
Protocol in Professional Broadcast Applications ST 2059-2:2015 \[127\].

TSN AF and TSCTSF may determine the PTP functionalities supported by
DS-TT and NW-TT and may configure PTP instances in DS-TT and NW-TT using
port and user plane node management information exchange as described in
Annex K, clause K.2.

NOTE: How the TSN AF or TSCTSF assigns NW-TT port(s) of one NW-TT to
different PTP instances is up to implementation.

#### 5.27.1.5 Detection of (g)PTP Sync and Announce timeouts

The procedure described in this clause is applicable when the PTP
instance in 5GS is configured to operate as a time-aware system or as a
Boundary Clock, and the PTP grandmaster is external to the 5GS, and the
BMCA procedure (Method a) is used as described in clause 5.27.1.6.

The NW-TT processes Announce messages according to
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

In particular, the NW-TT shall compute and maintain the time when the
Announce and Sync timeout events occur for the PTP port in a Follower
state. When the 5GS is configured to operate as a time-aware system, the
NW-TT shall determine the Sync and Announce message interval for the PTP
Port at the other end of the link to which the Follower PTP Port in 5GS
is attached, as described in IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\]. When the 5GS is
configured to operate as a Boundary Clock, the NW-TT shall determine
Announce interval based on the configuration of the Follower port in
5GS, as described in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

The configuration of PTP instances in DS-TT and NW-TT for Sync and
Announce timeouts is described in clause K.2. Upon detection of the Sync
or Announce timeout event, the NW-TT shall re-evaluate the DS-TT and
NW-TT port states as described in clause 5.27.1.6.

#### 5.27.1.6 Distribution of Announce messages and best master clock selection

The procedure described in this clause is applicable if DS-TT and NW-TT
support operating as a Boundary Clock described in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]
or as a time-aware system (support of the IEEE 802.1AS \[104\] PTP
profile) and when the PTP instance in 5GS is configured to operate as a
time-aware system or as a Boundary Clock. Whether DS-TT/NW-TT support
operating as a Boundary Clock or as a time-aware system may be
determined as described in clause K.2.1.

The externally-observable behaviour of the Announce message handling by
5GS needs to comply with IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] or
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], respective to the configured mode of operation.

The DS-TT forwards the received Announce messages to NW-TT over User
plane. The NW-TT port forwards the received Announce messages from N6
interface to NW-TT.

The NW-TT maintains the PTP port state for each DS-TT port and NW-TT
port. The PTP port states may be determined by NW-TT either via:

\- Method a), BMCA procedure.

\- Method b), local configuration.

When Method b) is used, the following applies:

\- When the PTP GM is external to the 5GS, for one of the NW-TT or DS-TT
ports (per each PTP domain) the PTP port state is Follower and for all
other NW-TT and DS-TT ports of the same PTP domain the PTP port state is
set either to Passive or Leader (depending on implementation).

\- When the 5GS is configured as a grandmaster for a (g)PTP domain for
the connected networks, all NW-TT ports and DS-TT ports are set to
Leader state for that (g)PTP domain.

The local configuration of PTP port states in DS-TT and NW-TT for Method
b is described in clause K.2.

When the Method a) is used (PTP port states are determined by BMCA
procedure), the NW-TT needs to process the received Announce messages
(from NW-TT port(s) and over user plane from the DS-TT(s)) for BMCA
procedure, determine port states within the 5GS, and maintain the
Leader-Follower hierarchy.

The DS-TT maintains the Disabled, Initializing and Faulty (if
applicable) state for the PTP ports in DS-TT. While in Disabled,
Initializing or Faulty state, the port in the DS-TT discards any (g)PTP
messages it may receive from the upstream PTP instance or from the NW-TT
via user plane.

When the 5GS Clock is determined as a grandmaster for a (g)PTP domain,
the Announce messages are distributed as described in clause 5.27.1.7.

When the grandmaster is external to the 5GS, the NW-TT regenerates the
Announce messages based on the Announce messages received from Follower
port in NW-TT or DS-TT for the Leader ports in NW-TT and DS-TT(s). The
NW-TT/UPF forwards the regenerated Announce messages to the PDU
session(s) related to the Leader ports in the DS-TT(s).

NOTE 1: The TSN AF or TSCTSF can use the portDS.portState in the \"Time
synchronization information for each DS-TT port\" element in UMIC to
read and get notified for the port state changes for the PTP ports in
DS-TT(s), and the portDS.portState in PMIC to read and get notified for
the port state changes for the PTP ports in NW-TT. Based on the change
of the port states, TSN AF or TSCTSF can determine that an external
Grandmaster PTP Instance is found to be used instead of the GM in 5GS,
or the GM in 5GS is selected as the Grandmaster PTP Instance, and TSN AF
or TSCTSF can disable or enable the (g)PTP grandmaster functionality in
DS-TT(s), respectively.

NOTE 2: The TSN AF or TSCTSF can use the portDS.portState in PMIC to
read and get notified for the port state changes for the PTP ports in
DS-TT for the port state Disabled, Initializing or Faulty (if
applicable). The TSCTSF or TSN AF can use the portDS.portEnable to
indicate to the NW-TT that the DS-TT port is disabled. This avoids
unnecessary (g)PTP traffic over User Plane to a DS-TT port in Disabled,
Initializing or Faulty state.

#### 5.27.1.7 Support for PTP grandmaster function in 5GS

The 5GS that is configured to operate as a time-aware system or Boundary
Clock may support acting as a PTP grandmaster for a (g)PTP domain.

The configuration of PTP instances in DS-TT and NW-TT for PTP
grandmaster function is described in clause K.2.

The following options may be supported (per DS-TT) for the 5GS to
generate the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages for the Leader ports
on the DS-TT:

a\) NW-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages on behalf
of DS-TT (e.g. if DS-TT does not support this).

The NW-TT/UPF forwards the generated Sync, Follow_Up and Announce
messages to the PDU session(s) related to the Leader ports on the
DS-TT(s). The NW-TT timestamps the (g)PTP event message when the event
message is sent to the PDU Session, and adds TSi corresponding to the
timestamp to the Sync message and the OriginTimestamp corresponding to
the timestamp to Sync message (if one-step operation is used) or
PreciseOriginTimestamp corresponding to the timestamp to Follow_Up
message (if two-step operation is used), and sets the cumulative
rateRatio value with 1. The OriginTimestamp or PreciseOriginTimestamp
shall be set by NW-TT/UPF to the 5GS internal clock.

When DS-TT(s) receive the Sync, Follow_Up messages, it modifies the
payload of the Sync, Follow_Up message as described for the PTP port in
the egress TT in clause 5.27.1.2.2.2.

b\) DS-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages in this
DS-TT. The OriginTimestamp or PreciseOriginTimestamp shall be set by
DS-TT to the 5GS internal clock.

In both options, the NW-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce
messages for the Leader ports on the NW-TT.

#### 5.27.1.8 Exposure of Time Synchronization

5G System supports time synchronization service that can be activated
and deactivated by AF. Exposure of time synchronization comprises the
following capabilities:

\- The AF may learn 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for time
synchronization service.

\- The AF controls activation and deactivation of the time
synchronization service for the target UE(s).

The AF may use the service-specific parameters to control the time
synchronization service for targeted UE(s). These parameters are
specified in clause 4.15.9.3 and 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\] for
(g)PTP-based and 5G access stratum-based time synchronization services,
respectively.

The AF may subscribe for 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for
time synchronization service. The AF indicates in the request the DNN,
S-NSSAI, and in addition the AF may indicate a list of UE identities or
group identity to limit the subscription only to corresponding UEs. If
the AF does not indicate DNN, S-NSSAI, the NEF determines the DNN,
S-NSSAI based on the AF Identifier.

The TSCTSF (directly or via NEF) exposes the 5GS and/or UE availability
and capabilities for synchronization service to the AF as described in
clause 4.15.9.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The exposed information includes the
list of user plane node identities, the list of UE identities and may
include the supported capabilities for (g)PTP time synchronization
service per user plane node and UE.

The AF request to control the (g)PTP time synchronization service is
sent to the TSCTSF (directly or via NEF). The request is targeted to a
set of AF-sessions that are associated with the exposure of UE
availability and capabilities for synchronization service.

The AF may request to use a specific PTP instance type when requesting
the (g)PTP-based time synchronization distribution method
(IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] or IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] operation (i.e. as a
Boundary Clock, peer-to-peer Transparent Clock, or end-to-end
Transparent Clock or as a PTP relay instance)). The request to control
the (g)PTP time synchronization service may contain other service
parameters as specified in Table 4.15.9.3-1 in clause 4.15.9.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AF may request to use the 5G access stratum as a time
synchronization distribution method. In this case, the time source is
provided by the 5GS. 5G-AN provides the 5GS time to the UE via 3GPP
radio access; UE/DS-TT may provide 5G access stratum timing information
to end stations using implementation specific means. The request to
control the 5G access stratum time distribution (including the
parameters such AF requests may contain) is described in clause 4.15.9.4
of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AF or NEF selects the TSCTSF as specified in clause 6.3.24.

The AF request may include a time synchronization error budget (see also
clause 5.27.1.9). The time synchronization error budget defines an upper
bound for time synchronization errors introduced by 5GS.

The AF uses the procedure for configuring the (g)PTP instance in 5GS as
described in clause 4.15.9.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\] and uses the procedure
for providing the 5G access stratum time distribution as described in
clause 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\] for the UEs.

The TSCTSF uses the Time Synchronization parameters (Table 4.15.9.3-1 in
TS 23.502 \[3\]) as received from the AF (directly or via NEF) to
control the (g)PTP time synchronization service. When IEEE Std
1588 \[126\] or IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] operation have been selected,
the TSCTSF determines the necessary (g)PTP parameters to activate and
control the service in DS-TT(s) and NW-TTs. For this purpose, the TSCTSF
uses the PMIC or UMIC to manage the IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] or
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] operation in the DS-TT(s) or NW-TTs,
respectively (see clause 5.27.1.4).

The TSCTSF uses the Time Synchronization parameters (Table 4.15.9.4-1)
as received from the AF (directly or via NEF) to control the 5G access
stratum time synchronization distribution as described in
clause 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

For handling (g)PTP traffic, the PCF, according to PCC rule
authorization, chooses a 5QI and dynamically set the PDB and/or MDBV
according to requirements for (g)PTP protocol. The PCF provides the SMF
with a PCC rule generated based on the AF request to control the (g)PTP
time synchronization service. The SMF may take the information in the
PCC rule to modify a PDU Session to create or modify or release a QoS
Flow for transmitting the (g)PTP messages. The PCF acknowledges the
policy request to the TSCTSF. The TSCTSF may report the result of the
time synchronization request to the AF (directly or via NEF).

The AF may provide a temporal validity condition to the TSCTSF (directly
or via NEF) when the AF activates the time synchronization service.
Temporal validity condition contains the start-time and stop-time (in
absolute time value) attributes that describe the time period when the
time synchronization service is active for the targeted AF sessions. The
TSCTSF manages the temporal validity condition as described in clauses
4.15.9.3 and 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 5.27.1.9 Support for derivation of Uu time synchronization error budget

The AF may request a specific time synchronization error budget when
requesting a time synchronization service employing the (g)PTP-based or
5G access stratum-based time distribution method. If the AF includes a
time synchronization error budget in its request, the TSCTSF uses it to
derive an error budget available for the NG-RAN to provide the 5G access
stratum time via the Uu interface to each targeted UE (referred to as Uu
time synchronization error budget hereafter).

To derive the Uu time synchronization error budget for each targeted UE,
the TSCTSF takes the following into account:

\- selected time synchronization distribution method ( i.e.5G access
stratum-based time distribution or (g)PTP-based time distribution);

\- in the case of the (g)PTP-based time distribution:

\- whether 5GS operates as a boundary clock and acts as a GM;

\- whether a clock connected to the DS-TT/NW-TT acts as a GM;

\- PTP port states;

\- a CN part and a Device part of the time synchronization error budget
(both parts may be predefined at the TSCTSF, or calculated by the 5GS
using the implementation-specific means).

If the AF does not include a time synchronization error budget, the
TSCTSF uses a preconfigured time synchronization error budget to derive
the Uu time synchronization error budget. TheTSCTSF provides a 5G access
stratum time distribution indication and the derived Uu time
synchronization error budget to NG-RAN as described in clause 4.15.9.4
of TS 23.502 \[3\]. Based on this, NG-RAN provides the 5G access stratum
time to the UE according to the Uu interface time synchronization error
budget as provided by the TSCTSF (if supported by UE and NG-RAN). During
Handover, Service Request, mobility registration and AM policy
modification procedure, the AMF may provide the 5G access stratum time
distribution indication and the Uu time synchronization error budget to
NG-RAN as described in clause 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\], if needed.

NOTE: This release of the specification assumes that deployments ensure
that the targeted UEs and the NG-RAN nodes serving those UEs support
Rel-17 propagation delay compensation as defined in TS 38.300 \[27\].

### 5.27.1a Periodic deterministic communication

This clause describes 5G System features that allow support of periodic
deterministic communication where the traffic characteristics are known
a-priori, and a schedule for transmission from the UE to a downstream
node, or from the UPF to an upstream node is provided via external
protocols outside the scope of 3GPP (e.g. IEEE 802.1 TSN).

The features include the following:

\- Providing TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) that describe TSC flow
traffic characteristics (as described in clause 5.27.2) at the gNB
ingress and the egress of the UE for traffic in downlink and uplink
direction, respectively;

\- Support for hold & forward buffering mechanism (see clause 5.27.4) in
DS-TT and NW-TT to de-jitter flows that have traversed the 5G System.

### 5.27.2 TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) and TSC Assistance Container (TSCAC)

#### 5.27.2.1 General

TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) is defined in Table 5.27.2-1 and
describes TSC traffic characteristics for use in the 5G System. TSCAI
may be used by the 5G-AN, if provided by SMF. The knowledge of TSC
traffic pattern is useful for 5G-AN as it allows more efficiently
scheduling of QoS Flows that have a periodic, deterministic traffic
characteristics either via Configured Grants, Semi-Persistent Scheduling
or with Dynamic Grants.

The TSCTSF determines the TSC Assistance Container (defined in Table
5.27.2-2) based on information provided by an AF/NEF as described in
clause 5.27.2.3 and provides it to the PCF for IP type and Ethernet type
PDU Sessions. In the case of integration with IEEE TSN network, the TSN
AF determines TSC Assistance Container as described in clause 5.27.2.2
and provides it to the PCF for Ethernet PDU Sessions. The PCF receives
the TSC Assistance Container from the TSCTSF or the TSN AF and forwards
it to the SMF as part of PCC rule as described in clause 6.1.3.23a of
TS 23.503 \[45\].

The SMF binds a PCC rule with a TSC Assistance Container to a QoS Flow
as described in clause 6.1.3.2.4 of TS 23.503 \[45\]. The SMF uses the
TSC Assistance Container to derive the TSCAI for that QoS Flow and sends
the derived TSCAI to the NG-RAN. The Periodicity, Burst Arrival Time,
and Survival Time components of the TSCAI are specified by the SMF with
respect to the 5G clock. The SMF is responsible for mapping the Burst
Arrival Time and Periodicity from an external clock (when available) to
the 5G clock based on the time offset and cumulative rateRatio (when
available) between the external clock time and 5GS time as measured and
reported by the UPF. The SMF determines the TSCAI as described in
clause 5.27.2.4.

A Survival Time, which indicates the time period an application can
survive without any data burst, may be provided by TSN AF/AF either in
terms of maximum number of messages (message is equivalent to all
packets of a data burst) or in terms of time units. Only a single data
burst is expected within a single time period referred to as the
periodicity.

The SMF may send an update of the TSCAI to the NG-RAN as defined in
clauses 4.3.3.2, 4.9.1.2.2 and 4.9.1.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 5.27.2.2 TSC Assistance Container determination based on PSFP

In the case of integration with IEEE TSN network, the TSN AF determines
a TSC Assistance Container (defined in Table 5.27.2-2) and provides it
to the PCF. The determination of TSC Assistance Container based on
Per-Stream Filtering and Policing (PSFP) information applies only to
Ethernet type PDU Sessions.

NOTE 1: This clause assumes that PSFP information as defined in
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] and Table 5.28.3.1-1is provided by CNC. PSFP
information may be provided by CNC if TSN AF has declared PSFP support
to CNC. TSN AF indicates the support for PSFP to CNC only if all the
DS-TT and NW-TT ports of the 5GS Bridge have indicated support of PSFP.
Means to derive the TSC Assistance Container if PSFP is not supported by
5GS and/or the CNC are beyond the scope of this specification.

The TSN AF may be able to identify the ingress port and thereby the PDU
Session as described in clause 5.28.2.

The TSN AF interfaces towards the CNC for the PSFP
(IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\]) managed objects that correspond to the PSFP
functionality implemented by the DS-TT and the NW-TT. Thus, when PSFP
information is provided by the CNC, the TSN AF may extract relevant
parameters from the PSFP configuration. The TSN AF calculates traffic
pattern parameters (such as burst arrival time with reference to the
ingress port and periodicity). TSN AF also obtains the flow direction as
specified in clause 5.28.2. Survival Time may be pre-configured in TSN
AF.

TSN AF may enable aggregation of TSN streams if the TSN streams belong
to the same traffic class, terminate in the same egress port and have
the same periodicity and compatible Burst arrival time. When Survival
Time information is provided for a TSN stream, then it should not be
aggregated with other TSN streams into a single QoS Flow, or if they are
aggregated, then the Survival Time parameter shall not be provided. One
set of parameters and one TSC Assistance Container are created by the
TSN AF for multiple TSN streams to enable aggregation of TSN streams to
the same QoS Flow.

Annex I describe how the traffic pattern information is determined.

NOTE 2: Further details of aggregation of TSN streams (including
determination of burst arrival times that are compatible so that TSN
streams can be aggregated) are left for implementation.

NOTE 3: In order for the TSN AF to get Burst Arrival Time, Periodicity
on a per TSN stream basis, support for IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] (as stated
in clause 4.4.8.2) Per-Stream Filtering and Policing (PSFP) with stream
gate operation is a prerequisite.

For a UE-UE TSC stream, the (TSN) AF divides the stream into one uplink
stream and one or more downlink streams as defined in clause 5.28.2. The
TSN AF binds the uplink and downlink streams to the PDU Sessions, and
provides the streams on AF Session basis to the PCF(s). The TSN AF
calculates traffic pattern parameters for the UL and the DL stream using
the PSFP configuration (if provided) respectively:

\- For the uplink stream, the Flow Direction is set to uplink and
traffic pattern parameters (such as burst arrival time with reference to
the ingress port and periodicity) is determined as described in Annex I.

\- For downlink stream, the Flow Direction is set to downlink, the burst
arrival time is set to sum of burst arrival time of the UL stream and
5GS Bridge delay of PDU Session carrying the UL stream, and the
periodicity is determined as described in Annex I.

#### 5.27.2.3 TSC Assistance Container determination by TSCTSF

The TSCTSF constructs TSC Assistance Container (defined in Table
5.27.2-2) based on information provided (directly or via NEF) by the AF
for IP or Ethernet type PDU Sessions.

The AF may provide Flow Direction, Burst Arrival Time (optional) at the
UE/DS-TT (uplink) or UPF/NW-TT (downlink), Maximum Burst Size,
Periodicity, Survival Time (optional), and a Time Domain (optional) to
the TSCTSF. Based on these parameters, the TSCTSF constructs a TSC
Assistance Container and provides it to PCF. If the AF provides to the
TSCTSF a Burst Arrival Time or Periodicity without corresponding Time
Domain, the TSCTSF sets the Time Domain = \"5GS\" in the TSC Assistance
Container.

NOTE: The Maximum Burst Size is signalled separately, i.e. it is not
part of the TSC Assistance Container.

The AF provides these parameters to the NEF and the NEF forwards these
parameters to the TSCTSF. The AF trusted by the operator provides these
parameters to the TSCTSF directly.

The TSCTSF sends the TSC Assistance Container to the PCF as follows:

\- The TSCTSF uses the UE IP address/DS-TT port MAC address to identify
the PCF and N5 association related to the PDU Session of a UE/DS-TT.

#### 5.27.2.4 TSCAI determination based on TSC Assistance Container

The SMF determines the TSCAI (defined in Table 5.27.2-1) for the QoS
Flow based on the TSC Assistance Container of the PCC rule bound to the
QoS Flow. This clause is applicable irrespective of whether the TSC
Assistance Container is determined by the TSN AF or by the TSCTSF.

The Burst Arrival Time and Periodicity component of the TSCAI that the
SMF sends to the 5G-AN are specified with respect to the 5G clock. The
SMF is responsible for mapping the Burst Arrival Time and Periodicity in
the TSC Assistance Container from an external clock to the 5G clock
based on the time offset and cumulative rateRatio (when available)
between external time and 5GS time as measured and reported by the UPF.
The SMF may correct the TSCAI based on the UPF report for time offset
and cumulative rateRatio between external PTP time and 5GS time as
measured and reported by the UPF.

The TSCAI parameter determination in SMF is done as follows:

\- For traffic in downlink direction, the SMF corrects the Burst Arrival
Time in the TSC Assistance Container based on the latest received time
offset measurement from the UPF and sets the TSCAI Burst Arrival Time as
the sum of the corrected value and CN PDB as described in
clause 5.7.3.4, representing the latest possible time when the first
packet of the data burst arrives at the AN.

\- For traffic in uplink direction, the SMF corrects the Burst Arrival
Time in the TSC Assistance Container based on the latest received time
offset measurement from the UPF and sets the TSCAI Burst Arrival Time as
the sum of the corrected value and UE-DS-TT Residence Time, representing
the latest possible time when the first packet of the data burst arrives
at the egress of the UE. How the SMF corrects the Burst Arrival Time if
the UE-DS-TT Residence Time has not been provided by the UE is up to SMF
implementation.

\- The SMF corrects the Periodicity in the TSC Assistance Container
using the cumulative rateRatio if the cumulative rateRatio was
previously received from the UPF and sets the TSCAI Periodicity as the
corrected value. Otherwise, the SMF sets the received Periodicity in the
TSCAI without any correction.

\- The SMF sets the TSCAI Flow Direction as the Flow Direction in the
TSC Assistance Container.

\- If Survival Time is provided in terms of maximum number of messages,
the SMF converts maximum number of messages into time units by
multiplying its value by the TSCAI Periodicity, and sets the TSCAI
Survival Time to the calculated value. If Survival Time is provided in
time units, the SMF corrects the Survival Time using the cumulative
rateRatio if the cumulative rateRatio was previously received from the
UPF and sets the TSCAI Survival Time to the corrected value. Otherwise,
SMF sets the TSCAI Survival Time without correction.

Depending on whether the Time Domain is provided in the TSC Assistance
container, SMF may perform the following:

\- the SMF provisions the UPF/NW-TT to report the clock drifting between
5G clock and the external GM clock for the (g)PTP time domain number
that is configured to the NW-TT.

\- the SMF provisions the UPF/NW-TT to report the clock drifting between
5G clock and the external GM clock for the given Time Domain number.

The SMF uses the N4 Association Setup or Update procedures as described
in clause 4.4.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\] to provision the UPF to report the
clock drifting.

If the SMF has clock drift information for a Time Domain and if the Time
Domain matches with the Time Domain in the TSC Assistance Container
(i.e. clock drift between 5G timing and AF supplied Time Domain
determined based on UPF reporting), or Time Domain information is not
provided in the TSC Assistance Container, then the SMF may adjust the
TSCAI information so that it reflects the 5GS Clock as described in
clause 5.27.2.1.

If the SMF does not have synchronization information for a requested
Time Domain in the TSC Assistance Container, or the Time Domain in the
TSC Assistance Container is set to a value = \"5GS\", then the TSCAI
information will be used without adjustment.

In the case of drift between external GM clock and 5G clock, the UPF
updates the offset to SMF using the N4 Report Procedure as defined in
clause 4.4.3.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. If the cumulative rateRatio is
available and in the case of change of cumulative rateRatio between
external PTP time and 5G time, the UPF updates the cumulative rateRatio
to SMF using the N4 Report Procedure as defined in clause 4.4.3.4 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. The SMF may then trigger a PDU Session Modification as
defined in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\] in order to update the TSCAI
to the NG-RAN without requiring AN or N1 specific signalling exchange
with the UE.

NOTE 4: In order to prevent frequent updates from the UPF, the UPF sends
the offset or the cumulative rateRatio only when the difference between
the current measurement and the previously reported measurement is
larger than a threshold as described in clause 4.4.3.4 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.27.3 Support for TSC QoS Flows

TSC QoS Flows use a Delay-critical GBR resource type and TSC Assistance
Information. TSC QoS Flows may use standardized 5QIs, pre-configured
5QIs or dynamically assigned 5QI values (which requires signalling of
QoS characteristics as part of the QoS profile) as specified in
clause 5.7.2. For each instance of Periodicity, within each Period
(defined by periodicity value), TSC QoS Flows are required to transmit
only one burst of maximum size MDBV within the 5G-AN PDB. Known QoS Flow
traffic characteristics provided in the TSCAI may be used to optimize
scheduling in the 5GS.

The following is applicable for the QoS profile defined for TSC QoS
Flows:

1\. The TSC Burst Size may be used to set the MDBV as follows:

The maximum TSC Burst Size is considered as the largest amount of data
within a time period that is equal to the value of 5G-AN PDB of the 5QI.
The maximum value of TSC Burst Size should be mapped to a 5QI with MDBV
that is equal or higher. When integration with IEEE TSN applies, this
5QI also shall have a PDB value that satisfies the bridge delay
capabilities (see clause 5.27.5 for more details) reported for the
corresponding traffic class. For TSC QoS Flows, the Maximum Burst Size
of the aggregated TSC streams to be allocated to this QoS Flow can be
similarly mapped to a 5QI with MDBV value that is equal or higher.

2\. The PDB is explicitly divided into 5G-AN PDB and CN PDB as described
in clause 5.7.3.4. Separate delay budgets are necessary for calculation
of expected packet transmit times on 5G System interfaces. For the TSC
QoS Flow, the5G-AN PDB is set to value of 5QI PDB minus the CN PDB as
described in clause 5.7.3.4. The CN PDB may be static value or dynamic
value and is up to the implementation of 5GS bridge.

3\. When integration with IEEE TSN applies, the Maximum Flow Bitrate
calculated by the TSN AF as per Annex I.1 may be used to set GBR. In
this case, MBR is set equal to GBR.

4\. ARP is set to a pre-configured value.

5\. 5QI value is derived using QoS mapping tables and TSN QoS
information as described in clause 5.28.4 in the case of integration
with IEEE TSN network, or using QoS Reference parameters and Requested
PDB, Burst Size, Priority parameters as described in clause 4.15.6.6 or
clause 4.15.6.6a of TS 23.502 \[3\] in the case of AF requested Time
Sensitive Communication.

### 5.27.4 Hold and Forward Buffering mechanism

DS-TT ports and NW-TT ports support a hold and forward mechanism to
schedule traffic as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 \[98\] if 5GS is to
participate transparently as a bridge in a TSN network. That is, the
hold and forward buffering mechanism in this release of the
specification provides externally observable behaviour identical to
scheduled traffic with up to eight queues (clause 8.6.8.4 in
IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 \[98\]) and with protected windows (Annex Q.2 in
IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 \[98\]). Frames are only transmitted from a given
buffer according to the open time interval of the corresponding
transmission gate; otherwise, frames are hold back (which corresponds to
a closed transmission gate). The protected windows scheme implies that
only a single transmission gate is open at any single time. Thus, the
Hold and Forward buffering mechanism allows PDB based 5GS QoS to be used
for TSC traffic.

For Ethernet frames that contain a VLAN tag, DS-TT and NW-TT determine
the priority based on the PCP value contained in the VLAN tag. For
Ethernet frames that do not contain a VLAN tag, DS-TT and NW-TT apply a
priority value of 0.

To achieve externally observable behaviour according to the protected
windows scheme, 5GS provides AdminControlList, AdminBaseTime,
AdminCycleTime and TickGranularity as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\]
on a per Ethernet port basis to DS-TT and NW-TT for the hold and forward
buffering mechanism as described in clause 5.28.3.

NOTE: The details of how Hold and Forward buffering mechanism is
provided by the DS-TT and NW-TT is up to implementation.

### 5.27.5 5G System Bridge delay

This clause applies if 5GS is integrated as a bridge into an IEEE TSN
network.

In order for the 5G System to participate as a TSN bridge according to
transmission gate schedules specified, the 5GS Bridge is required to
provide Bridge Delays as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc \[95\] for each
port pair and traffic class of the 5GS bridge to an IEEE 802.1 TSN
system. In order to determine 5GS Bridge Delays, the following
components are needed:

1\. UE-DS-TT Residence Time.

2\. Per traffic class minimum and maximum delays between the UE and the
UPF/NW-TT that terminates the N6 interface (including UPF and NW-TT
residence times), independent of frame length that a given 5GS
deployment supports. The per-traffic class delays between the UE and the
UPF/NW-TT are pre-configured in the TSN AF (see clause 5.28.4).

The TSN AF calculates the 5GS independentDelayMin and
independentDelayMax values for each port pair and for each traffic class
using the above components. If the UE-DS-TT Residence Time has not been
provided by the UE, then the TSN AF uses a locally configured minimum
UE-DS-TT Residence Time for the calculation of independentDelayMin and a
locally configured maximum UE-DS-TT Residence Time for the calculation
of independentDelayMax.

The dependentDelayMin and dependentDelayMax for 5GS Bridge specify the
time range for a single octet of an Ethernet frame to transfer from
ingress to egress and include the time to receive and store each octet
of the frame, which depends on the link speed of the ingress Port as per
IEEE Std 802.1Qcc \[95\].

NOTE: Further details how TSN AF determines dependentDelayMin and
dependentDelayMax are up to implementation.

Since residence times may vary among UEs and per traffic class delay
between the UE and the UPF/NW-TT may vary among UPFs, the 5GS Bridge
Delay is determined after the PDU Session Establishment for the
corresponding UPF and the UE by the TSN AF. The TSN AF deduces the
related port pair(s) from the port number of the DS-TT Ethernet port and
port number of the NW-TT Ethernet port(s) of the same 5GS Bridge when
the TSN AF receives the 5GS Bridge information for a newly established
PDU Session and calculates the bridge delays per port pair.
Additionally, TSN AF deduces the port pair(s) consisting of two DS-TT
ports connecting to the same 5GS bridge and determines the 5GS bridge
delay as sum of bridge delays related to PDU Sessions of two DS-TT
ports.

## 5.28 Support of integration with TSN

### 5.28.1 5GS bridge management

5GS acts as a Layer 2 Ethernet Bridge. When integrated with IEEE TSN
network, 5GS functions acts as one or more TSN Bridges of the TSN
network. The 5GS Bridge is composed of the ports on a single UPF (i.e.
PSA) side, the user plane tunnel between the UE and UPF, and the ports
on the DS-TT side. For each 5GS Bridge of a TSN network, the port on
NW-TT support the connectivity to the TSN network, the ports on DS-TT
side are associated to the PDU Session providing connectivity to the TSN
network.

The granularity of the 5GS TSN bridge is per UPF for each network
instance or DNN/S-NSSAI. The bridge ID of the 5GS TSN bridge is bound to
the UPF ID of the UPF as identified in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The TSN AF
stores the binding relationship between a port on UE/DS-TT side and a
PDU Session during reporting of 5GS TSN bridge information. The TSN AF
also stores the information about ports on the UPF/NW-TT side. The
UPF/NW-TT forwards traffic to the appropriate egress port based on the
traffic forwarding information. From the TSN AF point of view, a 5GS TSN
bridge has a single NW-TT entity within UPF and the NW-TT may have
multiple ports that are used for traffic forwarding.

NOTE 1: How to realize single NW-TT entity within UPF is up to
implementation.

NOTE 2: Ethernet PDU Session type in this release of the specification
may be subject to the constraint that it supports a single N6 interface
in a UPF associated with the N6 Network Instance.

There is only one PDU Session per DS-TT port for a given UPF. All PDU
Sessions which connect to the same TSN network via a specific UPF are
grouped into a single 5GS bridge. The capabilities of each port on
UE/DS-TT side and UPF/NW-TT side are integrated as part of the
configuration of the 5GS Bridge and are notified to TSN AF and delivered
to CNC for TSN bridge registration and modification.

NOTE 3: It is assumed that all PDU Sessions which connect to the same
TSN network via a specific UPF are handled by the same TSN AF.

Figure 5.28.1-1: Per UPF based 5GS bridge

NOTE 4: If a UE establishes multiple PDU Sessions terminating in
different UPFs, then the UE is represented by multiple 5GS TSN bridges.

In order to support IEEE 802.1Q features related to TSN, including TSN
scheduled traffic (clause 8.6.8.4 in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 \[98\]) over
5GS Bridge, the 5GS supports the following functions:

\- Configure the bridge information in 5GS.

\- Report the bridge information of 5GS Bridge to TSN network after PDU
Session establishment.

\- Receiving the configuration from TSN network as defined in
clause 5.28.2.

\- Map the configuration information obtained from TSN network into 5GS
QoS information (e.g. 5QI, TSC Assistance Information) of a QoS Flow in
corresponding PDU Session for efficient time-aware scheduling, as
defined at clause 5.28.2.

The bridge information of 5GS Bridge is used by the TSN network to make
appropriate management configuration for the 5GS Bridge. The bridge
information of 5GS Bridge includes at least the following:

\- Information for 5GS Bridge:

\- Bridge ID

Bridge ID is to distinguish between bridge instances within 5GS. The
Bridge ID can be derived from the unique bridge MAC address as described
in IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], or set by implementation specific means
ensuring that unique values are used within 5GS;

\- Number of Ports;

\- list of port numbers.

\- Capabilities of 5GS Bridge as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc \[95\]:

\- 5GS Bridge delay per port pair per traffic class, including 5GS
Bridge delay (dependent and independent of frame size, and their maximum
and minimum values: independentDelayMax, independentDelayMin,
dependentDelayMax, dependentDelayMin), ingress port number, egress port
number and traffic class.

\- Propagation delay per port (txPropagationDelay), including
transmission propagation delay, egress port number.

\- VLAN Configuration Information.

NOTE 5: This Release of the specification does not support the
modification of VLAN Configuration Information at the TSN AF.

\- Topology of 5GS Bridge as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB \[97\]:

\- LLDP Configuration Information.

\- Chassis ID subtype and Chassis ID of the 5GS Bridge.

\- LLDP Discovery Information for each discovered neighbor of each NW-TT
port and DS-TT port.

\- Traffic classes and their priorities per port as defined in
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\].

\- Stream Parameters as defined in clause 12.31.1 in
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], in order to support PSFP:

\- MaxStreamFilterInstances: The maximum number of Stream Filter
instances supported by the bridge;

\- MaxStreamGateInstances: The maximum number of Stream Gate instances
supported by the bridge;

\- MaxFlowMeterInstances: The maximum number of Flow Meter instances
supported by the bridge (optional);

\- SupportedListMax: The maximum value supported by the bridge of the
AdminControlListLength and OperControlListLength parameters.

The following parameters: independentDelayMax and independentDelayMin,
how to calculate them is left to implementation and not defined in this
specification.

DS-TT and NW-TT report txPropagationDelay to the TSN AF relative to the
time base of the TSN GM clock (identified by the TSN time domain number
received in PMIC). If the TSN AF has subscribed for notifications on
txPropagationDelay and if the difference to the previously reported
txPropagationDelay is larger than the txPropagationDelayDeltaThreshold
received in PMIC, the corresponding DS-TT or NW-TT informs the TSN AF
about the updated txPropagationDelay using PMIC signalling.

NOTE 6: Configuration of TSN time domain number and
txPropagationDelayDeltaThreshold via PMIC is optional for NW-TT. NW-TT
can instead be pre-configured with the threshold and the single time
domain that is used by the CNC for bridge configuration and reporting.

Bridge ID of the 5GS Bridge, port number(s) of the Ethernet port(s) in
NW-TT could be preconfigured on the UPF. The UPF is selected for a PDU
Session serving TSC as described in clause 6.3.3.3.

This release of the specification requires that each DS-TT port is
assigned with a globally unique MAC address.

NOTE 7: The MAC address of the DS-TT port must not be used in user data
traffic; it is used for identification of the PDU Session and the
associated bridge port within the 3GPP system.

When there are multiple network instances within a UPF, each network
instance is considered logically separate. The network instance for the
N6 interface (clause 5.6.12) may be indicated by the SMF to the UPF for
a given PDU Session during PDU Session establishment. UPF allocates
resources based on the Network Instance and S-NSSAI and it is supported
according to TS 29.244 \[65\]. DNN/S-NSSAI may be indicated by the SMF
together with the network instance to the UPF for a given PDU Session
during PDU Session establishment procedure.

The TSN AF is responsible to receive the bridge information of 5GS
Bridge from 5GS, as well as register or update this information to the
CNC.

### 5.28.2 5GS Bridge configuration

The configuration information of 5GS Bridge as defined in clause 8.6.8.4
of IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], includes the following:

\- Bridge ID of 5GS Bridge.

\- Configuration information of scheduled traffic on ports of DS-TT and
NW-TT:

\- Egress ports of 5GS Bridge, e.g. ports on DS-TT and NW-TT;

\- Traffic classes and their priorities.

NOTE 1: In this Release of the specification, scheduled traffic
(clause 8.6.8.4 in IEEE 802.1Q-2018 \[98\]) is only supported with
protected windows, (see clause Q.2 in IEEE 802.1Q \[98\]), therefore, it
is enough to support AdminControlList, AdminBaseTime, AdminCycleTime and
TickGranularity for the configuration of the 5GS.

The configuration information of 5GS Bridge as defined in
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], includes the following:

\- Chassis ID of 5GS Bridge;

\- Traffic forwarding information as defined in clause 8.8.1 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\]:

\- Destination MAC address and VLAN ID of TSN stream;

\- Port number in the Port MAP as defined in clause 8.8.1 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\].

\- Configuration information per stream according to clause 8.6.5.1 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] including:

\- Stream filters.

\- Stream gates.

NOTE 2: In order to support clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], it
is required to support the Stream Identification function as specified
by IEEE Std 802.1CB \[83\].

The SMF report the MAC address of the DS-TT port of the related PDU
Session to TSN AF via PCF. The association between the DS-TT MAC
address, 5GS Bridge ID and port number on DS-TT is maintained at TSN AF
and further used to assist to bind the TSN traffic with the UE\'s PDU
session.

Two models are supported to configure 5GS QoS for TSN traffic:

\- Based on the assumption that PSFP information is always provided by
CNC: In this case the QoS Flows are setup based on the PSFP information
provided by CNC;

NOTE 3: PSFP information may be provided by CNC if TSN AF has declared
PSFP support to CNC. TSN AF indicates the support for PSFP to CNC only
if each DS-TT and NW-TT of the 5GS bridge has indicated support of PSFP.

\- Without requiring PSFP information provided by the CNC.: In this
case, pre-configured QoS Flows are used and configured e.g. during PDU
session establishment as described in clause 5.28.4. Additional QoS
Flows are setup as necessary based on the PSFP, if available, as
described in this clause.

When PSFP information is available, TSN AF identifies the ingress and
egress port for the TSN stream as described in Annex I and determines
the DS-TT port MAC address(es) identifying the corresponding PDU
session(s) carrying the TSN stream. Flow direction of a TSN stream is
determined as follows: if the ingress port is a DS-TT port, then the
Flow direction is UL; otherwise if the ingress port(s) is (are) NW-TT
port, the Flow direction is DL. Flow direction is part of the TSCAI as
defined in clause 5.27.2.

The TSN AF uses the stream filter instances of PSFP information to
derive the service data flow for TSN streams. The TSN AF uses the
Priority values in the stream filter instances in PSFP information (if
available) as defined in clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], the
5GS bridge delay information (see clause 5.27.5) and may additionally
use scheduled traffic information as defined in clause 8.6.8.4 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\], to derive the TSN QoS information (i.e. priority
and delay) for a given TSN stream or flow of aggregated TSN streams as
specified in clause 5.28.4.

The TSN AF identifies the egress port(s) for the TSN stream using local
configuration or static filtering entry that matches the TSN stream. If
the TSN AF determines that the TSN stream is for UE-UE communication
(i.e. ingress and egress ports are in DS-TTs), the TSN AF divides the
stream into one uplink stream and one or more downlink streams and
provides the streams on AF Session basis to the PCF(s). The SMF applies
local switching as specified in clause 5.8.2.13 or clause 5.8.2.5.3 in
order to enable UPF locally forward uplink stream from one PDU session
as downlink stream in another PDU session.

When CNC configures the PSFP information to the TSN AF, TSN AF
determines the TSC Assistance Container as described in clause 5.27.2.
The TSN AF associates the TSN QoS information and TSC Assistance
Container (if available) with the corresponding service data flow
description and provides to the PCF and the SMF as defined in
clause 6.1.3.23 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

NOTE 4: When the TSN stream priority information from PSFP is not
available (priority value in stream filters is set to wild card), in
certain configurations it can be possible to use the scheduled traffic
information as defined in clause 8.6.8.4 of IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] to
derive the Priority of the TSN stream. For example, when there is a
single downlink stream for a given DS-TT port, it can be possible to
determine the affected DS-TT port in the downlink and the associated TSN
stream priority based on the scheduled traffic information of the
affected egress port, and to derive an estimated MDBV based on the gate
open interval and the assumed ingress port bitrate.

If TSN AF provides PSFP and/or scheduled traffic information to DS-TT
and NW-TT then DS-TT and NW-TT execute on this information relative to
the time base of the TSN GM clock (identified by the TSN time domain
number received in PMIC).

NOTE 5: Configuration of TSN time domain number via PMIC is optional for
NW-TT. NW-TT can instead be pre-configured with the single time domain
that is used by the CNC for bridge configuration and reporting.

### 5.28.3 Port and user plane node management information exchange in 5GS

#### 5.28.3.1 General

Port number of the DS-TT for the PDU Session is assigned by the UPF
during PDU session establishment. The port number of the DS-TT port for
a PDU Session shall be reported to the SMF from the UPF and further
stored at the SMF. The SMF provides the DS-TT port number via PCF to the
TSN AF or TSCTSF. TSN AF or TSCTSF maintains an association between the
DS-TT port number and the DS-TT port MAC address (with Ethernet type PDU
session) or IP address (applicable for TSCTSF only, with IP type PDU
Session) of the UE. If a PDU session for which SMF has reported a DS-TT
port number to TSN AF or TSCTSF is released, then SMF informs TSN AF or
TSCTSF accordingly.

NOTE 1: Port number can refer either to Ethernet port or PTP port. In
Ethernet type PDU Sessions, it is assumed that the PTP port number is
the same as the associated Ethernet port number.

5GS shall support transfer of standardized and deployment-specific port
management information transparently between TSN AF or TSCTSF and DS-TT
or NW-TT, respectively inside a Port Management Information Container.
NW-TT may support one or more ports. In this case, each port uses
separate Port Management Information Container. 5GS shall also support
transfer of standardized and deployment-specific user plane node
management information transparently between TSN AF or TSCTSF and NW-TT,
respectively inside a User Plane Node Management Information Container.
Table 5.28.3.1-1 and Table 5.28.3.1-2 list standardized port management
information and user plane node management information, respectively.

If TSN AF is deployed, i.e. if 5GS is integrated with an IEEE TSN
network, the port and user plane node management information is
exchanged between CNC and TSN AF. The port management information is
related to ports located in DS-TT or NW-TT. The user plane node
management information container is related to 5GS bridge management.

If TSN AF is not deployed, the port and user plane node management
information is exchanged between TSCTSF and DS-TT/NW-TT.

NOTE 2: The time synchronization parameters used in Port Management
Information Container and User Plane Node Management Information
Container are from IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], Edition 2019, and from
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\]. Since the IEEE time synchronization data sets
are not exposed, care needs to be taken when interoperating with devices
supporting Edition 2008, IEEE Std 1588-2008 \[107\] (which can be the
case when operating under the SMPTE profile, ST 2059-2:2015 \[127\]) and
using a common management.

+-----------------------------------+---------+--------+--------------+

Exchange of port and user plane node management information between TSN
AF or TSCTSF and NW-TT or between TSN AF or TSCTSF and DS-TT allows TSN
AF or TSCTSF to:

1\) retrieve port management information for a DS-TT or NW-TT port or
user plane node management information;

2\) send port management information for a DS-TT or NW-TT port or user
plane node management information;

3\) subscribe to and receive notifications if specific port management
information for a DS-TT or NW-TT port changes or user plane node
management information changes.

4\) delete selected entries in the following data structures:

\- \"DS-TT port neighbour discovery configuration for DS-TT port\" in
UMIC using the DS-TT port number to reference the selected entry.

\- \"Stream Filter Instance Table\" in PMIC using the Stream Filter
Instance ID to reference the selected entry.

\- \"Stream Gate Instance Table\" in PMIC using the Stream Gate Instance
ID to reference the selected entry.

\- \"Static Filtering Entries table\" in UMIC using the (MAC address,
VLAN ID) pair to reference the selected entry.

5\) delete PTP Instances in a DS-TT port or NW-TT port using the PTP
Instance ID to reference the selected entry as described in
clause K.2.2.1.

Exchange of port management information between TSN AF or TSCTSF and
NW-TT or DS-TT is initiated by DS-TT or NW-TT to:

\- notify TSN AF or TSCTSF if port management information has changed
that TSN AF or TSCTSF has subscribed for.

Exchange of user plane node management information between TSN AF or
TSCTSF and NW-TT is initiated by NW-TT to:

\- notify TSN AF or TSCTSF if user plane node management information has
changed that TSN AF or TSCTSF has subscribed for.

Exchange of port management information is initiated by DS-TT to:

\- provide port management capabilities, i.e. provide information
indicating which standardized and deployment-specific port management
information is supported by DS-TT.

TSN AF or TSCTSF indicates inside the Port Management Information
Container or user plane node Management Information Container whether it
wants to retrieve or send port or user plane node management information
or intends to (un-)subscribe for notifications.

#### 5.28.3.2 Transfer of port or user plane node management information

Port management information is transferred transparently via 5GS between
TSN AF or TSCTSF and DS-TT or NW-TT, respectively, inside a Port
Management Information Container (PMIC). User plane node management
information is transferred transparently via 5GS between TSN AF or
TSCTSF and NW-TT inside a user plane node Management Information
Container (UMIC). The transfer of port or user plane node management
information is as follows:

\- To convey port management information from DS-TT or NW-TT to TSN AF
or TSCTSF:

\- DS-TT provides a PMIC and the DS-TT port MAC address (if available)
to the UE, which includes the PMIC as an optional Information Element of
an N1 SM container and triggers the UE requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure or PDU Session Modification procedure to forward
the PMIC to the SMF. SMF forwards the PMIC and the port number of the
related DS-TT port to TSN AF or TSCTSF as described in clauses 4.3.2.2
and 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\];

\- NW-TT provides PMIC(s) and/or UMIC to the UPF, which triggers the N4
Session Level Reporting Procedure to forward the PMIC(s) and/or UMIC to
SMF. UPF selects an N4 session corresponding to any of the N4 sessions
for this NW-TT. SMF in turn forwards the PMIC(s) and the port number(s)
of the related NW-TT port(s), or the UMIC, to TSN AF or TSCTSF as
described in clause 4.16.5.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 1: There has to be at least one established PDU session for DS-TT
port before the UPF can report PMIC/UMIC information towards the TSN AF
or TSCTSF.

\- To convey port management information from TSN AF or TSCTSF to DS-TT:

\- TSN AF or TSCTSF provides a PMIC, DS-TT port MAC address or UE IP
address (applicable for TSCTSF only) reported for a PDU Session (i.e.
MAC address of the DS-TT port or IP address related to the PDU session)
and the port number of the DS-TT port to manage to the PCF by using the
AF Session level Procedure, which forwards the information to SMF based
on the MAC or IP address using the PCF initiated SM Policy Association
Modification procedure as described in clause 4.16.5.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. SMF determines that the port number relates to a DS-TT
port and based on this forwards the PMIC to DS-TT using the network
requested PDU Session Modification procedure as described in
clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- To convey port or user plane node management information from TSN AF
or TSCTSF to NW-TT:

\- TSN AF or TSCTSF selects a PCF-AF session corresponding to any of the
DS-TT MAC or IP addresses (applicable for TSCTSF only) for the related
PDU sessions of this bridge and provides a PMIC(s) and the related NW-TT
port number(s) and/or UMIC to the PCF. The PCF uses the PCF initiated SM
Policy Association Modification procedure to forward the information
received from TSN AF or TSCTSF to SMF as described in clause 4.16.5.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. SMF determines that the included information needs to
be delivered to the NW-TT either by determining that the port number(s)
relate(s) to a NW-TT port(s) or based on the presence of UMIC, and
forwards the container(s) and/or related port number(s) to NW-TT using
the N4 Session Modification procedure described in clause 4.4.1.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 5.28.3.3 VLAN Configuration Information

The CNC obtains the 5GS bridge VLAN configuration from TSN AF according
to clause 12.10.1.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\]. The TSN AF and UPF/NW-TT
are pre-configured with same 5GS bridge VLAN configuration.

NOTE: In this Release, the VLAN Configuration Information are
pre-configured at the TSN AF and the NW-TT and is not exchanged between
the TSN AF and the UPF/NW-TT.

### 5.28.4 QoS mapping tables

The mapping tables between the traffic class and 5GS QoS Profile is
provisioned and further used to find suitable 5GS QoS profile to
transfer TSN traffic over the PDU Session. QoS mapping procedures are
performed in two phases: (1) QoS capability report phase as described in
clause 5.28.1, and (2) QoS configuration phase as in clause 5.28.2

\(1\) The TSN AF shall be pre-configured (e.g. via OAM) with a mapping
table. The mapping table contains TSN traffic classes, pre-configured
bridge delays (i.e. the preconfigured delay between UE and UPF/NW-TT)
and priority levels. Once the PDU session has been setup and after
retrieving the information related to UE-DS-TT residence time, the TSN
AF deduces the port pair(s) in the 5GS bridge and determines the bridge
delay per port pair per traffic class based on the pre-configured bridge
delay and the UE-DS-TT residence time as described in clause 5.27.5. The
TSN AF updates bridge delays per port pair and traffic class and reports
the bridge delays and other relevant TSN information such as the Traffic
Class Table (clause 12.6.3 in IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\]) for every port,
according to the IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\] and IEEE Std 802.1Qcc \[95\] to
the CNC.

\(2\) CNC may distribute PSFP information and transmission gate
scheduling parameters to 5GS Bridge via TSN AF, which can be mapped to
TSN QoS requirements by the TSN AF.

The PCF mapping table provides a mapping from TSN QoS information (see
clauses 6.2.1.2 and 6.1.3.23 of TS 23.503 \[45\]) to 5GS QoS profile.
Based on trigger from TSN AF, the PCF may trigger PDU session
modification procedure to establish a new 5G QoS Flow or use the
pre-configured 5QI for 5G QoS Flow for the requested traffic class
according to the selected QoS policies and the TSN AF traffic
requirements.

Figure 5.28.4-1 illustrates the functional distribution of the mapping
tables.

![](media/image71.emf)

Figure 5.28.4-1: QoS Mapping Function distribution between PCF and TSN
AF

The minimum set of TSN QoS-related parameters that are relevant for
mapping the TSN QoS requirements are used by the TSN AF: traffic classes
and their priorities per port, TSC Burst Size of TSN streams, 5GS bridge
delays per port pair and traffic class (independentDelayMax,
independentDelayMin, dependentDelayMax, dependentDelayMin), propagation
delay per port (txPropagationDelay) and UE-DS-TT residence time.

Once the CNC retrieves the necessary information, it proceeds to
calculate scheduling and paths. The configuration information is then
set in the bridge as described in clauses 5.28.2 and 5.28.3. The most
relevant information received is the PSFP information and the schedule
of transmission gates for every traffic class and port of the bridge. At
this point, it is possible to retrieve the TSN QoS requirements by
identifying the traffic class of the TSN stream. The traffic class to
TSN QoS and delay requirement (excluding the UE-DS-TT residence time)
mapping can be performed using the QoS mapping table in the TSN AF as
specified in TS 23.503 \[45\]. Subsequently in the PCF, the 5G QoS Flow
can be configured by selecting a 5QI as specified in TS 23.503 \[45\].
This feedback approach uses the reported information to the CNC and the
feedback of the configuration information coming from the CNC to perform
the mapping and configuration in the 5GS.

If the Maximum Burst Size of the aggregated TSC streams in the traffic
class is provided by CNC via TSN AF to PCF, PCF can derive the required
MDBV taking the Maximum Burst Size as input. If the default MDBV
associated with a standardized 5QI or a pre-configured 5QI in the QoS
mapping table cannot satisfy the aggregated TSC Burst Size, the PCF
provides the derived MDBV in the PCC rule and then the SMF performs QoS
Flow binding as specified in clause 6.1.3.2.4 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

Maximum Flow Bit Rate is calculated over PSFPAdminCycleTime as described
in Annex I and provided by the TSN AF to the PCF. The PCF sets the GBR
and MBR values to the Maximum Flow Bitrate value.

The Maximum Flow Bit Rate is adjusted according to Averaging Window
associated with a pre-configured 5QI in the QoS mapping table or another
selected 5QI (as specified in TS 23.503 \[45\]) to obtain GBR of the 5GS
QoS profile. GBR is then used by SMF to calculate the GFBR per QoS Flow.
QoS mapping table in the PCF between TSN parameters and 5GS parameters
should match the delay, aggregated TSC burst size and priority, while
preserving the priorities in the 5GS. An operator enabling TSN services
via 5GS can choose up to eight traffic classes to be mapped to 5GS QoS
profiles.

Once the 5QIs to be used for TSN streams are identified by the PCF as
specified in TS 23.503 \[45\], then it is possible to enumerate as many
bridge port traffic classes as the number of selected 5QIs.

When PSFP information is not available to the TSN AF for a given TSN
stream (e.g. because of lack of PSFP support in the DS-TTs or the
NW-TTs, or exceeding the number of supported table entries for PSFP
functions, or because CNC does not provide PSFP information), the 5GS
can support the TSN streams using pre-configured mapping from stream
priority (i.e. PCP as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q \[98\]) to QoS Flows.

## 5.29 Support for 5G LAN-type service

### 5.29.1 General

The service requirements for 5G LAN-type service are specified in
TS 22.261 \[2\].

A 5G Virtual Network (VN) group consists of a set of UEs using private
communication for 5G LAN-type services.

### 5.29.2 5G VN group management

5G System supports management of 5G VN Group identification and
membership (i.e. definition of 5G VN group identifiers and membership)
and 5G VN Group data (i.e. definition of 5G VN group data). The 5G VN
Group management can be configured by a network administrator or can be
managed dynamically by AF.

A 5G VN group is characterized by the following:

\- 5G VN group identities: External Group ID and Internal Group ID are
used to identify the 5G VN group.

\- 5G VN group membership: The 5G VN group members are uniquely
identified by GPSI. The group as described in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] is applicable to 5G LAN-type services.

\- 5G VN group data. The 5G VN group data may include the following
parameters: PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI and Application descriptor,
Information related with secondary authentication / authorization (e.g.
to enable IP address assignment by the DN-AAA).

The Information related with secondary authentication / authorization
corresponds to the procedures described in clause 5.6.6; it allows e.g.
the AF to provide DN-AAA server addressing information and possibly to
request the SMF to get the UE IP address from the DN-AAA server.

In order to support dynamic management of 5G VN Group identification and
membership, the NEF exposes a set of services to manage (e.g.
add/delete/modify) 5G VN groups and 5G VN members. The NEF also exposes
services to dynamically manage 5G VN group data.

A 5G VN group is identified by the AF using External Group ID. The NEF
provides the External Group ID to UDM. The UDM maps the External Group
ID to Internal Group ID. For a newly created 5G VN Group, an Internal
Group ID is allocated by the UDM.

The NEF can retrieve the Internal Group ID from UDM via Nudm_SDM_Get
service operation (External Group ID, Group Identifier translation).

An External Group ID for a 5G VN group corresponds to a unique set of 5G
VN group data parameters.

The 5G VN group configuration is either provided by OA&M or provided by
an AF to the NEF.

When configuration is provided by an AF, the procedures described in
clause 4.15.6.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] apply for storing the 5G VN group
identifiers, group membership information and group data in the UDR, as
follows:

\- The NEF provides the External Group ID, 5G VN group membership
information and 5G VN group data to the UDM.

\- The UDM updates the Internal Group ID-list of the corresponding UE\'s
subscription data in UDR, if needed.

\- The UDM updates the Group Identifier translation in the Group
Subscription data with the Internal Group ID, External Group ID and list
of group members, if needed.

\- The UDM stores/updates the 5G VN group data (PDU session type, DNN
and S-NSSAI, Application descriptor, Information related with secondary
authentication / authorization) in UDR.

NOTE 1: It is assumed that all members of a 5G VN group belong to the
same UDM Group ID. The NEF can select a UDM instance supporting the UDM
Group ID of any of the member GPSIs of the 5G VN group.

NOTE 2: Shared data mechanisms as defined in TS 29.503 \[122\] can be
used to support large 5G VN groups.

If a UE is member of a 5G VN Group, UDM retrieves UE subscription data
and corresponding 5G VN group data from UDR, and provides the AMF and
SMF with UE subscription data with 5G VN group data included.

The PCF generates URSP rules based on 5G VN group data. The PCF
retrieves 5G VN group data from UDR. The PCF(s) that have subscribed to
modifications of 5G VN group data receive(s) a Nudr_DM_Notify
notification of 5G VN group data change from the UDR as defined in
TS 29.505 \[145\]. The PCF receives from the AMF at the UE Policy
association establishment the Internal Group ID(s) corresponding to a
UE, so that PCF identifies the 5G VN group data that needs to be used to
generate URSP rules to the UE. If the PCF is made aware of a change of
UE Internal Group Identifier(s) as defined in TS 29.525 \[144\] or
change of 5G VN group membership as defined in TS 29.505 \[145\], or
both, the PCF then may update the URSP rules for the impacted 5G VN
group members.

NOTE 3: The proper way to obtain the 5G VN group membership changes of a
specific UE, e.g. if the UE is added to a new 5G VN group, is via the
notification of change of UE Internal Group Identifier(s) from the AMF
as specified in TS 29.525 \[144\]. The subscription in the UDR is for
being notified about changes in the 5G VN group data and in the 5G VN
group membership of a specific 5G VN group.

An AF may update the UE Identities of the 5G VN group at any time after
the initial provisioning.

The PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI provided within 5G VN group data
cannot be modified after the initial provisioning.

In this Release of the specification, the home network of the 5G VN
group members is same.

In this Release of the specification, only a 1:1 mapping between (DNN,
S-NSSAI) combination and 5G VN group is supported.

The PCF delivers 5G VN group configuration information (DNN, S-NSSAI,
PDU session type) to the UE for each GPSI that belongs to a 5G VN group.
The 5G VN group configuration information is delivered in the URSP from
the PCF to the UE using the UE Configuration Update procedure for
transparent UE Policy delivery as described in clause 4.2.4.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] and clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

### 5.29.3 PDU Session management

Session management as defined for 5GS in clause 5.6 is applicable to
5G-VN-type services with the following clarification and enhancement:

\- A UE gets access to 5G LAN-type services via a PDU Session of IP PDU
Session type or Ethernet PDU Session type.

\- A PDU Session provides access to one and only one 5G VN group. The
PDU Sessions accessing to a certain 5G VN group should all anchor at the
same network, i.e. the common home network of 5G VN group members.

\- A dedicated SMF is responsible for all the PDU Sessions for
communication of a certain 5G VN group. SMF selection is described in
clause 6.3.2.

NOTE 1: The network is configured so that the same SMF is always
selected for a certain 5G VN group, e.g. only one SMF registers on the
NRF with the DNN/S-NSSAI used for a given 5G VN group.

NOTE 2: Having a dedicated SMF serving a 5G VN does not contradict that
redundancy solutions can be used to achieve high availability.

\- A DNN and S-NSSAI is associated with a 5G VN group.

\- The UE provides the DNN and S-NSSAI associated with the 5G VN group
to access the 5G LAN-type services for that 5G VN, using the PDU Session
Establishment procedure described in clause 4.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- During establishment of the PDU Session, secondary authentication as
described in clause 5.6.6 and in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], may
be performed in order to authenticate and authorize the UE for accessing
the DNN and S-NSSAI associated with the 5G VN group. Authentication and
authorization for a DNN and S-NSSAI using secondary authentication
implies authentication and authorization for the associated 5G VN group.
There is no 5G VN group specific authentication or authorization
defined.

\- The SM level subscription data for a DNN and S-NSSAI available in
UDM, as described in clause 5.6.1, applies to the DNN and S-NSSAI
associated to a 5G VN group.

\- Session management related policy control for a DNN and S-NSSAI as
described in TS 23.502 \[3\], is applicable to the DNN and S-NSSAI
associated to a 5G VN group. This includes also usage of URSP, for the
UE to determine how to route outgoing traffic to a PDU Session for the
DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G VN group.

\- Session and service continuity SSC mode 1, SSC mode 2, and SSC mode 3
as described in clause 5.6.9 are applicable to N6-based traffic
forwarding of 5G VN communication within the associated 5G VN group.

\- A PDU Session provides unicast, broadcast and multicast communication
for the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G VN group. The PSA UPF
determines whether the communication is for unicast, broadcast or
multicast based on the destination address of the received data, and
performs unicast, broadcast or multicast communication handling.

\- During the PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF retrieves SM
subscription data related to 5G-VN type service from the UDM as part of
the UE subscription data for the DNN and S-NSSAI.

\- In order to realize N19 traffic routing, the SMF correlates PDU
sessions established to the same 5G VN group and uses this to configure
the UPF with the group level N4-session including packet detection and
forwarding rules for N19 tunnelling forwarding.

### 5.29.4 User Plane handling

User Plane management as defined for 5GS in clause 5.8 is applicable to
5G LAN-type services with the following clarifications:

\- There are three types of traffic forwarding methods allowed for 5G VN
communication:

\- N6-based, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN communication is
forwarded to/from the DN;

NOTE 1: Optionally a L2TP tunnel can be established over N6 as described
in clause 5.8.2.16.

\- N19-based, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN group communication
is forwarded between PSA UPFs of different PDU sessions via N19. N19 is
based on a shared User Plane tunnel connecting PSA UPFs of a single 5G
VN group.

\- Local switch, where traffic is locally forwarded by a single UPF if
this UPF is the common PSA UPF of different PDU Sessions for the same 5G
VN group.

\- The SMF handles the user plane paths of the 5G VN group, including:

\- The SMF may prefer to select a single PSA UPF for as many PDU
sessions (targeting the same 5G VN group) as possible, in order to
implement local switch on the UPF.

\- (if needed) Establishing N19 tunnels between PSA UPFs to support
N19-based traffic forwarding.

\- For Ethernet PDU Session, the SMF may instruct the UPF(s) to classify
frames based on VLAN tags, and to add and remove VLAN tags, on frames
received and sent on N6 or N19 or internal interface (\"5G VN
internal\"), as described in clause 5.6.10.2.

NOTE 2: For handling VLAN tags for traffic on N6, TSP ID could also be
used as described in clause 6.2.2.6 of TS 23.503 \[45\].

Further description on User Plane management for 5G VN groups is
available in clause 5.8.2.13.

When N6-based traffic forwarding is expected, after creation of a 5G VN
group the AF can influence the traffic routing for all the members of
the 5G VN group, by providing information identifying the traffic,
DNAI(s) suitable for selection and an optional indication of traffic
correlation together with a 5G VN External Group ID identifying the 5G
VN group in an AF request sent to the PCF, as described in clause 5.6.7.
If the optional indication of traffic correlation is provided, it means
the PDU sessions of the 5G VN group member UEs should be correlated by a
common DNAI in the user plane for the traffic. The PCF transforms the AF
request into policies that apply to PDU Sessions of the 5G VN group and
sends the policies to the SMF. According to the policies, the SMF
(re)selects DNAI(s) for the PDU Sessions and configures their UP paths
to route the traffic to the selected DNAI(s). If the policies include
the traffic correlation indication, the SMF (re)selects a common DNAI
for the PDU Sessions so that the traffic of the 5G VN group is routed to
the common DNAI.

NOTE 3: When receiving a new PDU session establishment request for a 5G
VN group, to avoid unnecessary N19 tunnels between UPFs, SMF can check
previously selected UPFs for the same 5G VN group, and decide whether a
previously selected UPF could serve the requested PDU session.

NOTE 4: N19 tunnel(s) can be established between a new UPF and other
UPF(s) that belongs to a 5G VN group when the new UPF is selected for
the 5G VN group during PDU session establishment. The N19 tunnel(s) to a
UPF can be released during or after PDU session release when there is no
more PDU sessions for a 5G VN group in that UPF. Establishment or
release of the N19 tunnels at the UPF is performed within a group-level
N4 Session.

## 5.30 Support for non-public networks

### 5.30.1 General

A Non-Public Network (NPN) is a 5GS deployed for non-public use, see
TS 22.261 \[2\]. An NPN is either:

\- a Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN), i.e. operated by an NPN
operator and not relying on network functions provided by a PLMN, or

\- a Public Network Integrated NPN (PNI-NPN), i.e. a non-public network
deployed with the support of a PLMN.

NOTE: An NPN and a PLMN can share NG-RAN as described in clause 5.18.

Stand-alone NPN are described in clause 5.30.2 and Public Network
Integrated NPNs are described in clause 5.30.3.

### 5.30.2 Stand-alone non-public networks

#### 5.30.2.0 General

SNPN 5GS deployments are based on the architecture depicted in
clause 4.2.3, the architecture for 5GC with untrusted non-3GPP access
(Figure 4.2.8.2.1-1) for access to SNPN services via a PLMN (and vice
versa) and the additional functionality covered in clause 5.30.2.

Alternatively, a Credentials Holder (CH) may authenticate and authorize
access to an SNPN separate from the Credentials Holder based on the
architecture specified in clause 5.30.2.9. Idle mode mobility is
supported as defined in clause 5.30.2.11. In this Release, direct access
to SNPN is specified for 3GPP access only.

The following 5GS features and functionalities are not supported for
SNPNs:

\- Interworking with EPS.

\- Also, emergency services when the UE accesses the SNPN over NWu via a
PLMN.

\- Roaming, e.g. roaming between SNPNs. However, it is possible for a UE
to access an SNPN with credentials from a CH as described in
clause 5.30.2.9.

\- Handover between SNPNs, between SNPN and PLMN or PNI NPN.

\- CIoT 5GS optimizations.

\- CAG.

\- Proximity based Services (ProSe) as defined in TS 23.304 \[128\].

\- 5G NSWO.

A UE with two or more network subscriptions, where one or more network
subscriptions may be for a subscribed SNPN, can apply procedures
specified for Multi-USIM UEs as described in clause 5.38. The UE shall
use a separate PEI for each network subscription when it registers to
the network.

NOTE: The number of preconfigured PEIs for a UE is limited. If the
number of network subscriptions for a UE is greater than the
preconfigured number of PEIs, the number of network subscriptions that
can be registered with the network simultaneously is restricted by the
number of pre-configured number of PEIs.

#### 5.30.2.1 Identifiers

The combination of a PLMN ID and Network identifier (NID) identifies an
SNPN.

NOTE 1: The PLMN ID used for SNPNs is not required to be unique. PLMN
IDs reserved for use by private networks can be used for non-public
networks, e.g. based on mobile country code (MCC) 999 as assigned by ITU
\[78\]). Alternatively, a PLMN operator can use its own PLMN IDs for
SNPN(s) along with NID(s), but registration in a PLMN and mobility
between a PLMN and an SNPN are not supported using an SNPN subscription
given that the SNPNs are not relying on network functions provided by
the PLMN.

The NID shall support two assignment models:

\- Self-assignment: NIDs are chosen individually by SNPNs at deployment
time (and may therefore not be unique) but use a different numbering
space than the coordinated assignment NIDs as defined in
TS 23.003 \[19\].

\- Coordinated assignment: NIDs are assigned using one of the following
two options:

1\. The NID is assigned such that it is globally unique independent of
the PLMN ID used; or

2\. The NID is assigned such that the combination of the NID and the
PLMN ID is globally unique.

NOTE 2: Which legal entities manage the number space is beyond the scope
of this specification.

NOTE 3: The use of SNPN with self-assignment model NID such that the
combination of PLMN ID and NID is not globally unique is not assumed for
the architecture described in Figure 5.30.2.9.3-1, Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1
and for SNPN - SNPN Mobility as described in clause 5.30.2.11.

The GIN shall support two assignment models:

\- Self-assignment: GINs are chosen individually and may therefore not
be unique. It is defined as in TS 23.003 \[19\]

\- Coordinated assignment: GIN uses a combination of PLMN ID and NID and
is assigned using one of the following two options as defined in
TS 23.003 \[19\].

1\. The GIN is assigned such that the NID is globally unique (e.g. using
IANA Private Enterprise Numbers) independent of the PLMN ID used; or

2\. The GIN is assigned such that the combination of the NID and the
PLMN ID is globally unique.

NOTE 4: Which legal entities manage the number space for GIN is beyond
the scope of this specification.

An optional human-readable network name helps to identify an SNPN during
manual SNPN selection. The human-readable network name and how it is
used for SNPN manual selection is specified in TS 22.261 \[2\] and
TS 23.122 \[17\].

#### 5.30.2.2 Broadcast system information

NG-RAN nodes which provide access to SNPNs broadcast the following
information:

\- One or multiple PLMN IDs

\- List of NIDs per PLMN ID identifying the non-public networks NG-RAN
provides access to

NOTE 1: It is assumed that an NG-RAN node supports broadcasting a total
of twelve NIDs. Further details are defined in TS 38.331 \[28\].

NOTE°2: The presence of a list of NIDs for a PLMN ID indicates that the
related PLMN ID and NIDs identify SNPNs.

\- Optionally:

\- A human-readable network name per SNPN;

NOTE 3: The human-readable network name per SNPN is only used for manual
SNPN selection. The mechanism how human-readable network name is
provided (i.e. whether it is broadcasted or unicasted) to the UE is
specified in TS 38.331 \[28\].

\- Information, as described in TS 38.300 \[27\], TS 38.331 \[28\] and
in TS 38.304 \[50\], to prevent UEs not supporting SNPNs from accessing
the cell, e.g. if the cell only provides access to non-public networks;

\- An indication per SNPN of whether access using credentials from a
Credentials Holder is supported;

\- List of supported Group IDs for Network Selection (GINs) per SNPN;

\- An indication per SNPN of whether the SNPN allows registration
attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured to select the SNPN,
i.e. UEs that do not have any PLMN ID and NID nor GIN broadcast by the
SNPN in the Credentials Holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred
SNPNs/GINs.

NOTE 4: Further details (including number of supported GINs per SNPN)
are defined in TS 38.331 \[28\].

#### 5.30.2.3 UE configuration and subscription aspects

An SNPN-enabled UE is configured with the following information for each
subscribed SNPN:

\- PLMN ID and NID of the subscribed SNPN;

\- Subscription identifier (SUPI) and credentials for the subscribed
SNPN;

\- Optionally, an N3IWF FQDN and an identifier of the country where the
configured N3IWF is located;

\- Optionally, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials
from a Credentials Holder:

\- User controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;

\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;

\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of GINs.

For an SNPN-enabled UE with SNPN subscription, the Credentials Holder
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs may be updated
by the Credentials Holder using the Steering of Roaming (SoR) procedure
as defined in Annex C of TS 23.122 \[17\]. Updating Credentials Holder
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs via the
Steering of Roaming (SoR) procedure is not applicable for Credentials
Holder with AAA Server.

A subscription of an SNPN is either:

\- identified by a SUPI containing a network-specific identifier that
takes the form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI) using the NAI RFC
7542 \[20\] based user identification as defined in clause 28.7.2 of
TS 23.003 \[19\]. The realm part of the NAI may include the NID of the
SNPN; or

\- identified by a SUPI containing an IMSI.

NOTE 1: As to route network signalling to AUSF and UDM instances serving
the SNPN-enabled UE, the UE can be configured with Routing Indicator
locally or updated with Routing Indicator using the UE Parameters Update
via UDM Control Plane procedure defined in clause 4.20 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. When the SNPN credential is stored in the USIM, the
Routing Indicator is provisioned in the USIM, when the SNPN credential
is stored in the ME, the Routing Indicator is provisioned in the ME.

In the case of access to an SNPN using credentials owned by a
Credentials Holder as specified in clause 5.30.2.9.2 and
clause 5.30.2.9.3, the SUPI shall also contain identification for the
Credentials Holder (i.e. the realm in the case of Network Specific
Identifier based SUPI or the MCC and MNC in the case of an IMSI based
SUPI). In the case of access to an SNPN using credentials owned by a
Credentials Holder using AAA-S as specified in clause 5.30.2.9.2, only
Network Specific Identifier based SUPI is supported.

NOTE 2: When Credentials Holder is an SNPN, and the MCC and MNC of the
SNPN is not unique (e.g. MCC =999 is used and MNC is not coordinated
amongst the SNPNs), then IMSI based SUPI is not supported as the MCC and
MNC need not be globally unique always; instead USIM credentials are
supported using Network Specific Identifier based SUPI.

NOTE 3: Network Specific Identifier are not supported for the case the
Credentials Holder is provided by a PLMN.

NOTE 4: It is assumed that normally the SNPN and the Credentials Holder
use different PLMN ID. If the SNPN and CHs (where CH can be another SNPN
or a PLMN) share PLMN ID, and IMSI based SUPI is used, then the Routing
Indicator can be used for AUSF/UDM discovery and selection as long as
the Routing Indicator values are coordinated among the involved SNPN and
CHs. When the PLMN ID is not shared between SNPNs and CHs (where CH can
be another SNPN or a PLMN) and IMSI based SUPI is used, then PLMN ID is
sufficient to be used for AUSF/UDM discovery & selection unless the CHs
deploys multiple AUSF/UDM in which case also the Routing Indicator can
be used as long as the Routing Indicator values are coordinated within
the CH.

An SNPN-enabled UE that supports access to an SNPN using credentials
from a Credentials Holder and that is equipped with a PLMN subscription
may additionally be configured with the following information for SNPN
selection and registration using the PLMN subscription in SNPN access
mode:

\- User controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;

\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;

\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs.

For an SNPN-enabled UE with PLMN subscription, the Credentials Holder
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs may be updated
by the Credentials Holder using the Steering of Roaming (SoR) procedure
as defined in Annex C of TS 23.122 \[17\].

When the Credentials Holder updates a UE with the Credentials Holder
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs the UE may
perform SNPN selection again, e.g. to potentially select a higher
prioritized SNPN.

#### 5.30.2.4 Network selection in SNPN access mode

##### 5.30.2.4.1 General

An SNPN-enabled UE supports the SNPN access mode. When the UE is set to
operate in SNPN access mode the UE only selects and registers with SNPNs
over Uu as described in clause 5.30.2.4.

Emergency services are supported in SNPN access mode as defined in
clause 5.16.4.1.

If a UE is not set to operate in SNPN access mode, even if it is
SNPN-enabled, the UE does not select and register with SNPNs. A UE not
set to operate in SNPN access mode performs PLMN selection procedures as
defined in clause 4.4 of TS 23.122 \[17\]. For a UE capable of
simultaneously connecting to an SNPN and a PLMN, the setting for
operation in SNPN access mode is applied only to the Uu interface for
connection to the SNPN. Clause D.4 provides more details.

An SNPN-enabled UE that supports access to an SNPN using credentials
from a Credentials Holder and that is equipped with a PLMN subscription
needs to first enter SNPN access mode to be able to select SNPNs. Once
the UE has entered SNPN access mode, SNPN selection is performed as
described in clause 5.30.2.4. Once an SNPN has been selected the UE
attempts registration in the SNPN using the PLMN credentials.

NOTE: Details of activation and deactivation of SNPN access mode are up
to UE implementation.

When a UE is set to operate in SNPN access mode the UE does not perform
normal PLMN selection procedures as defined in clause 4.4 of
TS 23.122 \[17\].

UEs operating in SNPN access mode read the information described in
clause 5.30.2.2 from the broadcast system information and take them into
account during network selection.

##### 5.30.2.4.2 Automatic network selection

NOTE 1: If the UE has multiple SNPN subscriptions it is assumed that the
subscription to use for automatic selection is determined by
implementation specific means prior to network selection.

For automatic network selection the UE selects and attempts registration
on available and allowable SNPNs in the following order:

\- the SNPN the UE was last registered with (if available);

\- the subscribed SNPN, which is identified by the PLMN ID and NID for
which the UE has SUPI and credentials.;

\- If the UEs supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder then the UE continues by selecting and attempting
registration on available and allowable SNPNs which broadcast the
indication that access using credentials from a Credentials Holder is
supported in the following order:

\- SNPNs in the user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs (in
priority order);

\- SNPNs in the Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs (in priority order);

\- SNPNs, which additionally broadcast a GIN contained in the
Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs (in
priority order);

NOTE 2: If multiple SNPNs are available that broadcast the same GIN, the
order in which the UE selects and attempts a registration with those
SNPNs is implementation specific.

\- SNPNs, which additionally broadcast an indication that the SNPN
allows registration attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured
to select the SNPN, i.e. the broadcasted NID or GIN is not present in
the Credentials Holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred
SNPNs/GINs in the UE.

NOTE 3: If multiple SNPNs are available that broadcast the indication
that the SNPN allows registration attempts from UEs that are not
explicitly configured to select the SNPN, the order in which the UE
selects and attempts a registration with those SNPNs is implementation
specific.

When a UE performs Initial Registration to an SNPN, the UE shall
indicate the PLMN ID and NID as broadcast by the selected SNPN to
NG-RAN. NG-RAN shall inform the AMF of the selected PLMN ID and NID.

##### 5.30.2.4.3 Manual network selection

For manual network selection UEs operating in SNPN access mode provide
to the user the list of SNPNs (each is identified by a PLMN ID and NID)
and related human-readable names (if available) of the available SNPNs
the UE has respective SUPI and credentials for. If the UEs supports
access to an SNPN using credentials from a Credentials Holder, the UE
also presents available SNPNs which broadcast the \"access using
credentials from a Credentials Holder is supported\" indication and the
human-readable names related to the SNPNs (if available).

NOTE: The details of manual SNPN selection are defined in
TS 23.122 \[17\].

When a UE performs Initial Registration to an SNPN, the UE shall
indicate the selected PLMN ID and NID as broadcast by the selected SNPN
to NG-RAN. NG-RAN shall inform the AMF of the selected PLMN ID and NID.

#### 5.30.2.5 Network access control

If a UE performs the registration or service request procedure in an
SNPN identified by a PLMN ID and a self-assigned NID and there is no
subscription for the UE, then the AMF shall reject the UE with an
appropriate cause code to temporarily prevent the UE from automatically
selecting and registering with the same SNPN.

If a UE performs the registration or service request procedure in an
SNPN identified by a PLMN ID and a coordinated assigned NID and there is
no subscription for the UE, then the AMF shall reject the UE with an
appropriate cause code to permanently prevent the UE from automatically
selecting and registering with the same SNPN.

NOTE: The details of rejection and cause codes is defined in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

If a UE performs the registration in an SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder and UE is not authorized to access that specific
SNPN, then the UDM can reject the UE which results in AMF rejecting the
registration request from the UE with an appropriate cause code to
prevent the UE from selecting and registering with the same SNPN using
credentials from the Credentials Holder as described in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

In order to prevent access to SNPNs for authorized UE(s) in the case of
network congestion/overload, Unified Access Control information is
configured per SNPN (i.e. as part of the subscription information that
the UE has for a given SNPN) and provided to the UE as described in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

#### 5.30.2.6 Cell (re-)selection in SNPN access mode

UEs operating in SNPN access mode only select cells and networks
broadcasting both PLMN ID and NID of the selected SNPN.

NOTE: Further details on the NR idle and inactive mode procedures for
SNPN cell selection is defined in TS 38.331 \[28\] and in
TS 38.304 \[50\].

#### 5.30.2.7 Access to PLMN services via stand-alone non-public networks

To access PLMN services, a UE in SNPN access mode that has successfully
registered with an SNPN may perform another registration via the SNPN
User Plane with a PLMN (using the credentials of that PLMN) following
the same architectural principles as specified in clause 4.2.8
(including the optional support for PDU Session continuity between PLMN
and SNPN using the Handover of a PDU Session procedures in clauses
4.9.2.1 and 4.9.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) and the SNPN taking the role of
\"Untrusted non-3GPP access\". Annex D, clause D.3 provides additional
details.

NOTE: QoS differentiation in the SNPN can be provided on per-IPsec Child
Security Association basis by using the UE or network requested PDU
Session Modification procedure described in clause 4.3.3.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. In the PLMN, N3IWF determines the IPsec child SAs as
defined in clause 4.12 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The N3IWF is preconfigured by
PLMN to allocate different IPsec child SAs for QoS Flows with different
QoS profiles.

To support QoS differentiation in the SNPN with network-initiated QoS,
the mapping rules between the SNPN and the PLMN are assumed to be
governed by an SLA including: 1) mapping between the DSCP markings for
the IPsec child SAs on NWu and the corresponding QoS, which is the QoS
requirement of the PLMN and is expected to be provided by the SNPN, and
2) N3IWF IP address(es) in the PLMN. The non-alteration of the DSCP
field on NWu is also assumed to be governed by an SLA and by
transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The packet
detection filters in the SNPN can be based on the N3IWF IP address and
the DSCP markings on NWu.

To support QoS differentiation in the SNPN with UE-requested QoS, the UE
can request for an IPsec SA the same 5QI from the SNPN as the 5QI
provided by the PLMN. It is assumed that UE-requested QoS is used only
when the 5QIs used by the PLMN are from the range of standardized 5QIs.
The packet filters in the requested QoS rule can be based on the N3IWF
IP address and the SPI associated with the IPsec SA.

Refer to clause D.7 for details on how to support QoS differentiation.

When the UE accesses the PLMN over NWu via a SNPN, the AMF in the
serving PLMN shall send an indication toward the UE during the
Registration procedure to indicate whether an IMS voice over PS session
is supported or not.

#### 5.30.2.8 Access to stand-alone non-public network services via PLMN

To access SNPN services, a UE that has successfully registered with a
PLMN over 3GPP access may perform another registration via the PLMN User
Plane with an SNPN (using the credentials of that SNPN) following the
same architectural principles as specified in clause 4.2.8 (including
the optional support for PDU Session continuity between PLMN and SNPN
using the Handover of a PDU Session procedures in clauses 4.9.2.1 and
4.9.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) and the PLMN taking the role of \"Untrusted
non-3GPP access\" of the SNPN, i.e. using the procedures for Untrusted
non-3GPP access in clause 4.12.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. Annex D, clause D.3
provides additional details. The case where UE that has successfully
registered with a PLMN over non-3GPP access to access SNPN services is
not specified in this Release.

NOTE: QoS differentiation in the PLMN can be provided on per-IPsec Child
Security Association basis by using the UE or network requested PDU
Session Modification procedure described in clause 4.3.3.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. In the SNPN, N3IWF determines the IPsec child SAs as
defined in clause 4.12 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The N3IWF is preconfigured by
SNPN to allocate different IPsec child SAs for QoS Flows with different
QoS profiles.

To support QoS differentiation in the PLMN with network-initiated QoS,
the mapping rules between the PLMN and the SNPN are assumed to be
governed by an SLA including: 1) mapping between the DSCP markings for
the IPsec child SAs on NWu and the corresponding QoS, which is the QoS
requirement of the SNPN and is expected to be provided by the PLMN, and
2) N3IWF IP address(es) in the SNPN. The non-alteration of the DSCP
field on NWu is also assumed to be governed by an SLA and by
transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The packet
detection filters in the PLMN can be based on the N3IWF IP address and
the DSCP markings on NWu.

To support QoS differentiation in the PLMN with UE-requested QoS, the UE
can request for an IPsec SA the same 5QI from the PLMN as the 5QI
provided by the SNPN. It is assumed that UE-requested QoS is used only
when the 5QIs used by the SNPN are from the range of standardized 5QIs.
The packet filters in the requested QoS rule can be based on the N3IWF
IP address and the SPI associated with the IPsec SA.

Refer to clause D.7 for details on how to support QoS differentiation.

When the UE accesses the SNPN over NWu via a PLMN, the AMF in the SNPN
shall send an indication toward the UE during the Registration procedure
to indicate whether an IMS voice over PS session is supported or not.

#### 5.30.2.9 SNPN connectivity for UEs with credentials owned by Credentials Holder

##### 5.30.2.9.1 General

SNPNs may support UE access using credentials owned by a Credentials
Holder separate from the SNPN. In this case the Session Management
procedures (i.e. PDU Sessions) terminate in an SMF in the SNPN.

When an SNPN supports UE access using credentials assigned by a
Credentials Holder separate from the SNPN, it is assumed that is
supported homogeneously within the whole SNPN.

Credentials Holder using AAA Server for primary authentication and
authorization is described in clause 5.30.2.9.2 and Credentials Holder
using AUSF and UDM for primary authentication and authorization is
described in clause 5.30.2.9.3.

##### 5.30.2.9.2 Credentials Holder using AAA Server for primary authentication and authorization

The AUSF and the UDM in SNPN may support primary authentication and
authorization of UEs using credentials from a AAA Server in a
Credentials Holder (CH).

\- If the UDM decides that the primary authentication is performed by
AAA Server in CH based on the UE\'s SUPI and subscription data. The Home
Network Identifier, is derived by UDM from the SUCI received from AUSF.
The UDM then instructs the AUSF that primary authentication by a AAA
Server in a CH is required, the AUSF shall discover and select the
NSSAAF, and then forward EAP messages to the NSSAAF. The NSSAAF selects
AAA Server based on the domain name corresponds to the realm part of the
SUPI, relays EAP messages between AUSF and AAA Server (or AAA proxy) and
performs related protocol conversion. The AAA Server acts as the EAP
Server for the purpose of primary authentication.

Editor\'s note: It is FFS if only SUCI using null scheme with anonymised
SUPI should be supported for this use case and will be decided by
SA WG3.

NOTE: The UDM in SNPN, based on SLA between Credentials Holder and SNPN,
is pre-configured with information indicating whether the UE needs
primary authentication from AAA Server.

\- The SUPI is used to identify the UE during primary authentication and
authorization towards the AAA Server. SUPI privacy is achieved according
to methods in clause I.5 of TS 33.501 \[29\].

\- The AMF discovers and selects the AUSF as described in clause 6.3.4
using the Home Network Identifier (realm part) and Routing Indicator
present in the SUCI provided by a UE configured as described in
clause 5.30.2.3.

\- The AMF and SMF shall retrieve the UE subscription data from UDM
using SUPI.

Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1 depicts the 5G System architecture for SNPN with
Credentials Holder using AAA Server for primary authentication and
authorization.

![](media/image72.emf)

Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1: 5G System architecture with access to SNPN using
credentials from Credentials Holder using AAA Server

NOTE: The NSSAAF deployed in the SNPN can support primary authentication
in the SNPN using credentials from Credentials Holder using a AAA Server
(as depicted) and/or the NSSAAF can support Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization with a Network Slice-Specific AAA
Server (not depicted).

##### 5.30.2.9.3 Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM for primary authentication and authorization

An SNPN may support primary authentication and authorization of UEs that
use credentials from a Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM. The
Credentials Holder may be an SNPN or a PLMN. The Credentials Holder UDM
provides to SNPN the subscription data.

NOTE 1: A list of functionalities not supported in SNPN is provided in
clause 5.30.2.0.

Optionally, an SNPN may support network slicing (including Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, Network Slice Access
Control and subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration
of network slices) for UEs that use credentials from a Credentials
Holder using AUSF and UDM. The SNPN retrieves NSSAA and NSSRG
information from the UDM of the Credentials Holder.

Figure 5.30.2.9.3-1 depicts the 5G System architecture for SNPN with
Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM for primary authentication and
authorization and network slicing.

NOTE 2: The architecture for SNPN and Credentials Holder using AUSF and
UDM is depicted as a non-roaming reference architecture as the UE is not
considered to be roaming, even though some of the roaming architecture
reference points are also used, e.g. for AMF and SMF in SNPN to register
with and retrieve subscription data from UDM of the Credentials Holder.

#### 5.30.2.10 Onboarding of UEs for SNPNs

##### 5.30.2.10.1 General

Onboarding of UEs for SNPNs allows the UE to access an Onboarding
Network (ONN) for the purpose of provisioning the UE with SNPN
credentials for primary authentication and other information to enable
access to a desired SNPN, i.e. (re-)select and (re-)register with SNPN.

To provision SNPN credentials in a UE that is configured with Default UE
credentials (see clause 5.30.2.10.2.4), the UE selects an SNPN as ONN
and establishes a secure connection with that SNPN referred to as
Onboarding SNPN (ON-SNPN), see more details in clause 5.30.2.10.2.

NOTE: If the UE is already provisioned with a set of SNPN credentials or
credentials owned by a Credentials Holder and needs to be provisioned
with an additional set of SNPN credentials, the UE can access an SNPN
using the network selection in SNPN access mode as described in
clause 5.30.2.4, normal registration (i.e. not registration for
onboarding) and normal PDU Session (i.e. not a restricted PDU Session
used for onboarding) and then leverage the SNPN\'s User Plane connection
to get access to a PVS. The PVS address can be provided in the same way
as when the Onboarding Network is a PLMN.

To provision SNPN credentials in a UE that is equipped with a USIM
configured with PLMN credentials, the UE selects a PLMN as ONN and
establishes a secure connection with that PLMN, see more details in
clause 5.30.2.10.3.

After the secure connection is established, the UE is provisioned with
SNPN credentials and possibly other data to enable discovery,
(re-)selection and (re-)registration for a desired SNPN, see more
details in clause 5.30.2.10.4.

ON-SNPN and SO-SNPN can be roles taken by either an SNPN or different
SNPNs. It is possible for the same network to be in both roles with
respect to a specific UE.

##### 5.30.2.10.2 Onboarding Network is an SNPN

##### 5.30.2.10.2.1 General {#general-73 .H6}

A UE configured with Default UE credentials may register with an ON-SNPN
for the provisioning of SO-SNPN credentials.

##### 5.30.2.10.2.2 Architecture {#architecture .H6}

Figures 5.30.2.10.2.2-1, 5.30.2.10.2.2-2 and 5.30.2.10.2.2-3 depict the
architecture for Onboarding of UEs in an ON-SNPN.

Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-2: Architecture for UE Onboarding in ON-SNPN when
the DCS includes a AAA Server used for primary authentication

![](media/image76.emf)

Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-3: Architecture for UE Onboarding in ON-SNPN when
the DCS is not involved during primary authentication

NOTE 1: AUSF in the ON-SNPN interfaces with the DCS via NSSAAF as shown
in Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-2 owned by an entity that is internal or
external to the ON-SNPN.

NOTE 2: The functionality with respect to exchange information between
PVS and SO-SNPN to provision SNPN credentials and other data from the
SO-SNPN in the UE is out of 3GPP scope.

NOTE 3: The dotted lines in Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-1, Figure
5.30.2.10.2.2-2 and Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-3 indicate that whether domains
(e.g. DCS domain, PVS domain, and SO-SNPN) are separated depends on the
deployment scenario.

NOTE 4: See TS 33.501 \[29\] for the functionality beyond AUSF, and
other interfaces required for security.

NOTE 5: When secondary authentication is used in the context of the UE
onboarding architecture in Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-3, the same S-NSSAI/DNN
or different S-NSSAI/DNNs can be used for the onboarding PDU Sessions of
different UEs even though the DN-AAA servers that authenticate the UEs
can reside in different administrative domains.

When the DCS is involved during mutual primary authentication during the
Onboarding procedure (as in Figure 5.30.10.2.2-1 and Figure
5.30.10.2.2-2), the following applies:

\- When the DCS includes an AUSF and a UDM functionality, then the AMF
selects AUSF in the DCS domain. The ON-SNPN and DCS domain are connected
via N32 and SEPP which are not shown in the Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-1.

\- When the DCS includes a AAA Server functionality, only NSI based SUPI
is supported and the AMF selects AUSF in the ON-SNPN. Based on local
configuration (e.g. using the realm part of the Onboarding SUCI), the
AUSF skips the UDM selection and directly performs primary
authentication towards DCS with AAA Server functionality using Default
UE credentials for primary authentication. The AUSF uses an NSSAAF (and
the NSSAAF may use a AAA-P which is not shown in the figure
5.30.2.10.2.2-2) to relay EAP messages towards the DCS including a AAA
Server. The NSSAAF selects AAA Server based on the domain name
corresponding to the realm part of the SUPI.

NOTE 5: The AMF in ON-SNPN uses the Home Network Identifier of the
Onboarding SUCI to select the DCS. It is assumed that the ON-SNPN is
configured on per Home Network Identifier basis to determine whether to
perform primary authentication with AUSF/UDM or AAA server.

\- Upon establishment of the PDU Session used for User Plane Remote
Provisioning the ON-SNPN may trigger secondary authentication procedure,
as described in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], with a DN-AAA using
Default UE credentials for secondary authentication as described in
clause I.9.2.4 of TS 33.501 \[29\].

When the DCS is not involved during primary authentication (as in Figure
5.30.10.2.2-3), the following applies:

\- The AMF selects a local AUSF as described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.6 and
performs primary authentication towards the local AUSF using Default UE
credentials for primary authentication as described in TS 33.501 \[29\].

\- Upon establishment of the PDU Session used for User Plane Remote
Provisioning the ON-SNPN may trigger secondary authentication procedure,
as described in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], with the DCS or with
a DN-AAA server using Default UE credentials for secondary
authentication, as described in clause I.9.2.4 of TS 33.501 \[29\]. When
secondary authentication is used, the SMF identifies the DCS or the
DN-AAA server as defined in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 6: If the secondary authentication fails, the SMF rejects the PDU
Session used for User Plane Remote Provisioning. Based on local policy
the AMF can deregister the UE as described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.7.

NOTE 7: The DCS and PVS can be owned by an administrative entity that
can be different from either the ON-SNPN or SO-SNPN. The ownership of
DCS and PVS is outside the scope of 3GPP.

##### 5.30.2.10.2.3 Broadcast system information {#broadcast-system-information-1 .H6}

When the SNPN supports Onboarding of UEs for SNPNs (i.e. the SNPN can be
used as ON-SNPN), the NG-RAN node additionally broadcasts the following
information:

\- An onboarding enabled indication that indicates whether onboarding is
currently enabled for the SNPN. The onboarding enabled indication is
broadcasted per cell e.g. to allow start of the onboarding procedure
only in parts of the SNPN.

NOTE: Onboarding enabled indication per cell does not affect mobility
management functions, i.e. once the UE selects the ON-SNPN as described
in clause 5.30.2.10.2.5 and successfully registers within ON-SNPN as
described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.6, the UE can move to a cell of the
ON-SNPN not indicating onboarding support and continue with the remote
provisioning as described in clause 5.30.2.10.4.

##### 5.30.2.10.2.4 UE Configuration Aspects {#ue-configuration-aspects .H6}

A UE enabled to support UE Onboarding, shall be pre-configured with
Default UE credentials, and the UE may be pre-configured with ON-SNPN
selection information. The Default UE credentials consist of credentials
for primary authentication and optionally credentials for secondary
authentication, as described in TS 33.501 clause I.9 \[29\].

NOTE 1: The content of the ON-SNPN network selection information depends
on UE implementation and can include SNPN network identifiers and/or
GIN(s).

The UE uses the ON-SNPN selection information for selection of ON-SNPN
(see clause 5.30.2.10.2.5).

The UE Configuration Data for UP Remote Provisioning is described in the
clause 5.30.2.10.4.2.

NOTE 2: It is assumed that the UE is not pre-configured with a S-NSSAI
and DNN for the purpose of UE onboarding in the ON-SNPN.

NOTE 3: The Default UE credentials for primary authentication are used
to derive a SUPI. When the UE derives the SUPI from the Default UE
credentials for primary authentication, the UE performs specific
onboarding procedure as described in clauses 5.30.2.10.2.5,
5.30.2.10.2.6 and 5.30.2.10.2.7.

##### 5.30.2.10.2.5 Network selection {#network-selection-1 .H6}

This clause applies only when the UE is in SNPN access mode.

When the UE wants to perform UE onboarding via an SNPN, the UE shall
perform ON-SNPN selection as described below. An ON-SNPN is an SNPN
providing onboarding access and enabling remote provisioning for a UE
registered for onboarding as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.4 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE: The trigger for the UE to initiate the UE Onboarding procedure is
UE implementation dependent (e.g. the trigger can be a power-on event in
the UE, or an input by the user).

For automatic or manual selection, the UE may select and attempt to
register to an ON-SNPN which broadcast the Onboarding enabled indication
described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.3 and matches the pre-configured ON-SNPN
selection information such as SNPN network identifier and/or GIN(s) (if
available) described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.4 according to the UE
implementation-specific logic. If the registration fails, the UE may
select and attempt to register to a different ON-SNPN as defined in
clause 4.9.3.1.3 or clause 4.9.3.1.4 of TS 23.122 \[17\].

##### 5.30.2.10.2.6 Registration for UE onboarding {#registration-for-ue-onboarding .H6}

When the user or UE has selected an ON-SNPN according to
clause 5.30.2.10.2.5, the UE establishes an RRC connection towards the
NG-RAN node of the ON-SNPN. The UE provides an indication in RRC
Connection Establishment that the RRC connection is for onboarding as
defined in TS 38.331 \[28\]. This indication allows the NG-RAN node to
select an appropriate AMF that supports the UE onboarding procedures.
The UE indicates the ON-SNPN as the selected network, and the NG-RAN
node shall indicate the selected PLMN ID and NID of the ON-SNPN to the
AMF.

NOTE 1: As the configuration information in the UE does not include any
S-NSSAI and DNN used for onboarding, the UE does not include S-NSSAI and
DNN in RRC when it registers for UE onboarding purposes to the ONN.

The UE shall initiate the NAS registration procedure by sending a NAS
Registration Request message with the following characteristics:

\- The UE shall set the 5GS Registration Type to the value \"SNPN
Onboarding\" indicating that the registration request is for onboarding.

\- The UE shall provide a SUCI derived from a SUPI as specified in
TS 23.003 \[19\] and TS 33.501 \[29\]. The SUPI shall uniquely identify
the UE and shall be derived from the Default UE credentials for primary
authentication. The SUPI used for onboarding may contain an IMSI or a
network-specific identifier. The ON-SNPN may determine the corresponding
DCS identity or address/domain, based on the SUCI (i.e. based on the
Home Network Identifier of the SUCI).

The UE does not include a Requested NSSAI in NAS signalling when it
registers for UE onboarding purposes to the ON-SNPN.

The AMF supporting UE onboarding is configured with AMF Onboarding
Configuration Data that includes e.g.:

\- S-NSSAI and DNN to be used for onboarding or a configured SMF for the
S-NSSAI and DNN used for onboarding.

\- Information to use a local AUSF(s) within the ON-SNPN for onboarding
of UEs with a SUCI for a DCS with AAA Server or for onboarding of UEs in
the case where the DCS is not involved during primary authentication.

NOTE 2: The S-NSSAI used for onboarding is assumed to be configured in
both the AMF (i.e. in the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data) and the
NG-RAN nodes for the corresponding Tracking Areas where onboarding is
enabled.

When the AMF receives a NAS Registration Request with a 5GS Registration
Type set to \"SNPN Onboarding\", the AMF:

\- starts an authentication procedure towards the AUSF, the
authentication procedure is specified in TS 33.501 \[29\]. The AMF may
be provided with PVS IP address(es) or PVS FQDN(s) from the DCS during
authentication procedure. The AMF selects an appropriate AUSF as
described in clause 6.3.4 based on the Home Network Identifier of the
SUCI used during onboarding or based on local configuration in the AMF.

\- applies the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data e.g. used to restrict
UE network usage to only onboarding for User Plane Remote Provisioning
of UE as described in clause 5.30.2.10.4.3.

\- stores in the UE context in AMF an indication that the UE is
registered for SNPN onboarding.

Upon successful authentication from AUSF, the AMF informs the UE about
the result of the registration. If the UE is not successfully
authenticated, the AMF shall reject the registration procedure for
onboarding, and the UE may select a different ON-SNPN to attempt to
register.

NOTE 3: The AMF does not interact with the UDM of the ON-SNPN or DCS
(i.e. for registration or subscription management purposes) when it
receives a NAS Registration Request with a 5GS Registration Type set to
\"SNPN Onboarding\" (see clause 4.2.2.2.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

##### 5.30.2.10.2.7 Deregistration from the ON-SNPN for onboarding registered UE {#deregistration-from-the-on-snpn-for-onboarding-registered-ue .H6}

Once remote provisioning of SO-SNPN credentials is completed, the UE
should initiate deregistration from the ON-SNPN.

Based on ON-SNPN policies, the AMF may start an implementation specific
timer once the UE has registered to the ON-SNPN for the purpose of
onboarding. Expiry of this timer triggers the AMF to deregister the
onboarding registered UE from the ON-SNPN.

The AMF may also deregister the UE when it determines that the PDU
Session used for User Plane Remote Provisioning has been released by the
SMF.

When AMF re-allocation occurs for a UE registered for SNPN onboarding
during mobility registration update procedure as described in
TS 23.502 \[3\] in clause 4.2.2.2.4 or during N2 based handover as
described in TS 23.502 \[3\] clause 4.9.1.3, the new AMF supporting SNPN
Onboarding should be selected as described in clause 6.3.5. If the new
AMF receives in UE context the indication that the UE is registered for
SNPN onboarding, the new AMF may start an implementation specific timer
for when to deregister the UE when the new AMF completes the
Registration procedure (i.e. sends Registration Accept to the UE) or
completes the N2 based handover procedure.

NOTE: This specific timer is used to prevent onboarding registered UEs
from staying at the ON-SNPN indefinitely.

##### 5.30.2.10.3 Onboarding Network is a PLMN

##### 5.30.2.10.3.1 General {#general-74 .H6}

A UE configured with PLMN credentials in USIM for primary authentication
may register with a PLMN for the provisioning of SO-SNPN credentials.

##### 5.30.2.10.3.2 Network selection and Registration {#network-selection-and-registration .H6}

This clause applies only when the UE is not in SNPN access mode.

When the UE is using PLMN credentials for accessing a PLMN as the
Onboarding Network (ONN), then regular network selection, as per
TS 23.122 \[17\] and regular initial registration procedures apply, as
per TS 23.502 \[3\]. After successfully registering to the ON-PLMN, the
UE is provisioned with the SO-SNPN credentials via User Plane as in
clause 5.30.2.10.4.4.

NOTE: When Onboarding network is a PLMN and the UE\'s subscription only
allows for Remote Provisioning, then based on PLMN policies, the AMF can
start an implementation specific timer once the UE has registered to the
PLMN. Expiry of this timer triggers the AMF to deregister the UE from
the PLMN. This specific timer is used to prevent registered UEs that are
only allowed for Remote Provisioning from staying at the PLMN
indefinitely.

##### 5.30.2.10.4 Remote Provisioning of UEs in Onboarding Network

##### 5.30.2.10.4.1 General {#general-75 .H6}

Remote Provisioning of UEs that registered with an Onboarding Network
enables provisioning the UE with SNPN credentials for primary
authentication and other information to enable access to the desired
SNPN.

Onboarding Services are provided using a PDU Session for DNN and S-NSSAI
used for onboarding allowing remote provisioning of UEs via User Plane.
The PDU Session may be restricted only to be used for Remote
Provisioning of the UE.

##### 5.30.2.10.4.2 Onboarding configuration for the UE {#onboarding-configuration-for-the-ue .H6}

In order to enable UP Remote Provisioning of SNPN credentials for a UE,
UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning are either
pre-configured on the UE or provided by the ONN. UE Configuration Data
for User Plane Remote Provisioning provided by the ONN take precedence
over corresponding configuration data stored in the UE.

UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning consist of PVS
IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s).

If the UE does not have any PVS IP address or PVS FQDN after the
establishment of the PDU Session used for User Plane Remote
Provisioning, the UE may construct an FQDN for PVS discovery as defined
in TS 23.003 \[19\].

The UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning may be
stored in the ME.

The UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning (i.e. PVS
IP address(es) or PVS FQDN(s), or both) may be either:

\- locally configured in the SMF of ONN; or

\- provided by the DCS to the AMF of ON-SNPN as part of the
authentication procedure as specified in TS 33.501 \[29\] and sent by
the AMF in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request message to the
SMF

The PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s) provided by the DCS take
precedence over the locally configured PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS
FQDN(s) in the ON-SNPN.

If the PCF is used for User Plane Remote Provisioning, the SMF provides
the UE Configuration Data to the PCF as described in
clause 5.30.2.10.4.3.

The UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning may be
provided to the UE during the establishment of the PDU Session used for
User Plane Remote Provisioning as part of Protocol Configuration Options
(PCO) in the PDU Session Establishment Response.

NOTE 1: If there are multiple PVS IP addresses and/or PVS FQDNs in the
UE, how the UE uses this information is up to UE implementation.

NOTE 2: The maximum number of PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s)
allowed to be provided to the UE via Protocol Configuration Options
(PCO) is specified in TS 24.501 \[47\].

##### 5.30.2.10.4.3 User Plane Remote Provisioning of UEs when Onboarding Network is an ON-SNPN {#user-plane-remote-provisioning-of-ues-when-onboarding-network-is-an-on-snpn .H6}

The AMF selects an SMF used for User Plane Remote Provisioning using the
SMF discovery and selection functionality as described in clause 6.3.2.
The S-NSSAI and DNN of the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data may be used
to discover and select an SMF for User Plane Remote Provisioning.
Alternatively, for SMF selection, the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data
may contain a configured SMF for the S-NSSAI and DNN used for
onboarding. The AMF provides Onboarding Indication to SMF via
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request message when a PDU Session used
for User Plane Remote Provisioning is established. During PDU Session
establishment for remote provisioning, the AMF may provide the PVS IP
address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s) to the SMF.

When a UPF is selected for User Plane Remote Provisioning, the UPF
selection function described in clause 6.3.3 for normal services is
applied considering the S-NSSAI and DNN used for onboarding.

The SMF or the PCF may store S-NSSAI and DNN information used for
onboarding. Onboarding Configuration Data available to PCF (for details
see TS 23.503 \[45\]) and/or SMF may include PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP
address(es). The SMF and the PCF may use Onboarding Indication and DNN
and S-NSSAI used for onboarding to access the Onboarding Configuration
Data.

NOTE: The SMF is aware about the PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s)
in one of the following ways: either received from the AMF or retrieved
locally from the Onboarding Configuration Data.

When the UE registered for Onboarding (i.e. 5GS Registration Type is set
to the value \"SNPN Onboarding\") successfully completes the User Plane
Remote Provisioning of SNPN credentials via the Onboarding Network, then
the UE should deregister from the Onboarding Network.

Initial QoS parameters used for User Plane Remote Provisioning are
configured in the SMF when dynamic PCC is not used.

Dynamic PCC may be used for a PDU Session used for User Plane Remote
Provisioning as described in TS 23.503 \[45\]. If a PCF is used and the
AMF provided an Onboarding Indication, the SMF provides Onboarding
Indication to the PCF when requesting an SM Policy Association. The SMF
may provide the UE Configuration Data (i.e. PVS IP address(es) and/or
PVS FQDN(s)) to the PCF when requesting an SM Policy Association.

The QoS Flows of a restricted PDU Session, which is associated with the
S-NSSAI/DNN used for Onboarding, shall be dedicated to Onboarding
Services. The SMF may configure in the UPF PDR(s) and FAR(s) including
PVS and DNS server IP addresses to block any traffic that is not from or
to PVS and DNS server addresses.

If the UE is registered for Onboarding (i.e. 5GS Registration Type is
set to the value \"SNPN Onboarding\"), the network should apply S-NSSAI
and DNN in the Onboarding Configuration Data for the PDU Session
Establishment request from the UE.

##### 5.30.2.10.4.4 User Plane Remote Provisioning of UEs when Onboarding Network is a PLMN {#user-plane-remote-provisioning-of-ues-when-onboarding-network-is-a-plmn .H6}

Subscription data of such a UE shall contain the DNN and S-NSSAI used
for onboarding.

The AMF selects an SMF used for User Plane Remote Provisioning using the
SMF discovery and selection functionality as described in clause 6.3.2,
considering the DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding provided by the UE
or the default DNN and S-NSSAI provided by UDM.

The UPF selection function described in clause 6.3.3 is applied,
considering the DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding.

The SMF may be configured with one or more PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP
address(es) per DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding. When the UE
requests a PDU Session used for User Plane Remote Provisioning by using
DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding, the SMF sends the PVS FQDN(s)
and/or PVS IP address(es) associated to the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU
Session to the UE as part of Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) in the
PDU Session Establishment Response if the following conditions are met:

\- the UE subscription data contains the DNN and S-NSSAI used for
onboarding; and

\- the SMF has obtained the PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es)
associated to the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session from local
configuration; and

\- the UE has requested PVS information via PCO in PDU Session
Establishment Request.

NOTE 1: Local PCC or dynamic PCC can be used as described for PLMNs in
TS 23.503 \[45\] and based on operator policy, PDR(s) and FAR(s) can be
configured to restrict traffic other than provisioning traffic between
PVS/DNS server(s) and UE(s).

NOTE 2: If the UE receives multiple PVS IP addresses and/or PVS FQDNs,
how the UE uses this information is up to UE implementation.

NOTE 3: The maximum number of PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s)
allowed to be provided to the UE via Protocol Configuration Options
(PCO) is specified in TS 24.501 \[47\].

#### 5.30.2.11 UE Mobility support for SNPN

If the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPN and PLMN, the network
selection is performed as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\] and UE performs
initial registration as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 1: When the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPN and PLMN, it is
up to UE implementation to activate/deactivate SNPN access mode.

If the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPNs, the network selection is
performed as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\], then the UE performs initial
or mobility registration as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 2: When the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPNs, it is up to UE
implementation whether and when to establish again PDU Sessions using
existing mechanism.

### 5.30.3 Public Network Integrated NPN

#### 5.30.3.1 General

Public Network Integrated NPNs are NPNs made available via PLMNs e.g. by
means of dedicated DNNs, or by one (or more) Network Slice instances
allocated for the NPN. The existing network slicing functionalities
apply as described in clause 5.15. When a PNI-NPN is made available via
a PLMN, then the UE shall have a subscription for the PLMN in order to
access PNI-NPN.

NOTE 1: Annex D provides additional consideration to consider when
supporting Non-Public Network as a Network Slice of a PLMN.

As network slicing does not enable the possibility to prevent UEs from
trying to access the network in areas where the UE is not allowed to use
the Network Slice allocated for the NPN, Closed Access Groups may
optionally be used to apply access control.

A Closed Access Group identifies a group of subscribers who are
permitted to access one or more CAG cells associated to the CAG.

CAG is used for the PNI-NPNs to prevent UE(s), which are not allowed to
access the NPN via the associated cell(s), from automatically selecting
and accessing the associated CAG cell(s).

NOTE 2: CAG is used for access control e.g. authorization at cell
selection and configured in the subscription as part of the Mobility
Restrictions i.e. independent from any S-NSSAI. CAG is not used as input
to AMF selection nor Network Slice selection. If NPN isolation is
desired, operator can better support NPN isolation by deploying network
slicing for PNI-NPN, configuring dedicated S-NSSAI(s) for the given NPN
as specified in Annex D, clause D.2 and restricting NPN\'s UE
subscriptions to these dedicated S-NSSAI(s).

The UE and PNI-NPN may support remote provisioning of credentials for
NSSAA or credentials for secondary authentication/authorization to the
UE, as specified in clause 5.39.

NOTE 3: After successful provisioning of the credentials to the UE,
specific service subscription data (e.g. to enable the use of PNI-NPN)
can be activated in the UE Subscription data in the UDR/UDM. This can
result in a change of the UE Subscription Data to include new S-NSSAI,
DNN or CAG information, which can trigger update of the UE
configurations, e.g. described in clause 5.15.5.2.2.

NOTE 4: The UE always has subscription to the HPLMN providing the
PNI-NPN and has a USIM that contains primary authentication credentials.

Support for Proximity based Services (ProSe) as defined in
TS 23.304 \[128\] in conjunction with CAG is not specified in this
Release of the specification.

#### 5.30.3.2 Identifiers

The following is required for identification:

\- A CAG is identified by a CAG Identifier which is unique within the
scope of a PLMN ID;

\- A CAG cell broadcasts one or multiple CAG Identifiers per PLMN;

NOTE 1: It is assumed that a cell supports broadcasting a total of
twelve CAG Identifiers. Further details are defined in TS 38.331 \[28\].

\- A CAG cell may in addition broadcast a human-readable network name
per CAG Identifier:

NOTE 2: The human-readable network name per CAG Identifier is only used
for presentation to user when user requests a manual CAG selection.

#### 5.30.3.3 UE configuration, subscription aspects and storage

To use CAG, the UE, that supports CAG as indicated as part of the UE
5GMM Core Network Capability, may be pre-configured or (re)configured
with the following CAG information, included in the subscription as part
of the Mobility Restrictions:

\- an Allowed CAG list i.e. a list of CAG Identifiers the UE is allowed
to access; and

\- optionally, a CAG-only indication whether the UE is only allowed to
access 5GS via CAG cells (see TS 38.304 \[50\] for how the UE identifies
whether a cell is a CAG cell);

The HPLMN may configure or re-configure a UE with the above CAG
information using the UE Configuration Update procedure for access and
mobility management related parameters described in clause 4.2.4.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The above CAG information is provided by the HPLMN on a per PLMN basis.
In a PLMN the UE shall only consider the CAG information provided for
this PLMN.

When the subscribed CAG information changes, UDM sets a CAG information
Subscription Change Indication and sends it to the AMF. The AMF shall
provide the UE with the CAG information when the UDM indicates that the
CAG information within the Access and Mobility Subscription data has
been changed. When AMF receives the indication from the UDM that the CAG
information within the Access and Mobility Subscription has changed, the
AMF uses the CAG information received from the UDM to update the UE.
Once the AMF updates the UE and obtains an acknowledgment from the UE,
the AMF informs the UDM that the update was successful and the UDM
clears the CAG information Subscription Change Indication flag.

The AMF may update the UE using either the UE Configuration Update
procedure after registration procedure is completed, or by including the
new CAG information in the Registration Accept or in the Registration
Reject or in the Deregistration Request or in the Service Reject.

When the UE is roaming and the Serving PLMN provides CAG information,
the UE shall update only the CAG information provided for the Serving
PLMN while the stored CAG information for other PLMNs are not updated.
When the UE is not roaming and the HPLMN provides CAG information, the
UE shall update the CAG information stored in the UE with the received
CAG information for all the PLMNs.

The UE shall store the latest available CAG information for every PLMN
for which it is provided and keep it stored when the UE is de-registered
or switched off, as described in TS 24.501 \[47\].

The CAG information is only applicable with 5GS.

NOTE: CAG information has no implication on whether and how the UE
accesses 5GS over non-3GPP access.

#### 5.30.3.4 Network and cell (re-)selection, and access control

The following is assumed for network and cell selection, and access
control:

\- The CAG cell shall broadcast information such that only UEs
supporting CAG are accessing the cell (see TS 38.300 \[27\],
TS 38.304 \[50\]);

NOTE 1: The above also implies that cells are either CAG cells or normal
PLMN cells. For network sharing scenario between SNPN, PNI-NPN and
PLMNs, please see clause 5.18.

\- In order to prevent access to NPNs for authorized UE(s) in the case
of network congestion/overload, existing mechanisms defined for Control
Plane load control, congestion and overload control in clause 5.19 can
be used, as well as the access control and barring functionality
described in clause 5.2.5, or Unified Access Control using the access
categories as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\] can be used.

\- For aspects of automatic and manual network selection in relation to
CAG, see TS 23.122 \[17\];

\- For aspects related to cell (re-)selection, see TS 38.304 \[50\];

\- The Mobility Restrictions shall be able to restrict the UE\'s
mobility according to the Allowed CAG list (if configured in the
subscription) and include an indication whether the UE is only allowed
to access 5GS via CAG cells (if configured in the subscription) as
described in clause 5.30.3.3;

\- During transition from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED and during
Registration after connected mode mobility from E-UTRAN to NG-RAN as
described in clause 4.11.1.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]:

\- The AMF shall verify whether UE access is allowed by Mobility
Restrictions:

NOTE 2: It is assumed that the AMF is made aware of the supported CAG
Identifier(s) of the CAG cell by the NG-RAN.

\- If the UE is accessing the 5GS via a CAG cell and if at least one of
the CAG Identifier(s) received from the NG-RAN is part of the UE\'s
Allowed CAG list, then the AMF accepts the NAS request;

\- If the UE is accessing the 5GS via a CAG cell and if none of the CAG
Identifier(s) received from the NG-RAN are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG
list, then the AMF rejects the NAS request and the AMF should include
CAG information in the NAS reject message. The AMF shall then release
the NAS signalling connection for the UE by triggering the AN release
procedure; and

\- If the UE is accessing the 5GS via a non-CAG cell and the UE\'s
subscription contains an indication that the UE is only allowed to
access CAG cells, then the AMF rejects the NAS request and the AMF
should include CAG information in the NAS reject message. The AMF shall
then release the NAS signalling connection for the UE by triggering the
AN release procedure.

\- During transition from RRC Inactive to RRC Connected state:

\- When the UE initiates the RRC Resume procedure for RRC Inactive to
RRC Connected state transition in a CAG cell, NG-RAN shall reject the
RRC Resume request from the UE if none of the CAG Identifiers supported
by the CAG cell are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG list according to the
Mobility Restrictions received from the AMF or if no Allowed CAG list
has been received from the AMF.

\- When the UE initiates the RRC Resume procedure for RRC Inactive to
RRC Connected state transition in a non-CAG cell, NG-RAN shall reject
the UE\'s Resume request if the UE is only allowed to access CAG cells
according to the Mobility Restrictions received from the AMF.

\- During connected mode mobility procedures within NG-RAN, i.e.,
handover procedures as described in clause 4.9.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]:

\- Source NG-RAN shall not handover the UE to a target NG-RAN node if
the target is a CAG cell and none of the CAG Identifiers supported by
the CAG cell are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG list in the Mobility
Restriction List or if no Allowed CAG list has been received from the
AMF;

\- Source NG-RAN shall not handover the UE to a non-CAG cell if the UE
is only allowed to access CAG cells based on the Mobility Restriction
List;

\- If the target cell is a CAG cell, target NG-RAN shall reject the N2
based handover procedure if none of the CAG Identifiers supported by the
CAG cell are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG list in the Mobility
Restriction List or if no Allowed CAG list has been received from the
AMF;

\- If the target cell is a non-CAG cell, target NG-RAN shall reject the
N2 based handover procedure if the UE is only allowed to access CAG
cells based on the Mobility Restriction List.

\- Update of Mobility Restrictions:

\- When the AMF receives the Nudm_SDM_Notification from the UDM and the
AMF determines that the Allowed CAG list or the indication whether the
UE is only allowed to access CAG cells have changed;

\- The AMF shall update the Mobility Restrictions in the UE and NG-RAN
accordingly under the conditions as described in clause 4.2.4.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 3: When the UE is accessing the network for emergency services the
conditions for AMF in clause 5.16.4.3 apply.

#### 5.30.3.5 Support of emergency services in CAG cells

Emergency Services are supported in CAG cells, for UEs supporting CAG,
whether normally registered or emergency registered as described in
clause 5.16.4 and in clause 4.13.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

A UE may camp on an acceptable CAG cell in limited service state as
specified in TS 23.122 \[17\] and TS 38.304 \[50\], based on operator
policy defined in TS 38.300 \[27\].

NOTE: Support for Emergency services requires each cell with a Cell
Identity associated with PLMNs or PNI-NPNs to only be connected to AMFs
that supports emergency services.

The UE shall select a PLMN (of a CAG cell or non-CAG cell), as described
in TS 23.122 \[17\] and TS 23.167 \[18\], when initiating emergency
services from limited service state.

During handover to a CAG cell, if the UE is not authorized to access the
target CAG cell as described in clause 5.30.3.4 and has emergency
services, the target NG-RAN node only accepts the emergency PDU Session
and the target AMF releases the non-emergency PDU Sessions that were not
accepted by the NG-RAN node. Upon completion of handover the UE behave
as emergency registered.

## 5.31 Support for Cellular IoT

### 5.31.1 General

This clause provides an overview about 5GS optimisations and
functionality for support of Cellular Internet-of-Things (Cellular IoT,
or CIoT) according to service requirements described in TS 22.261 \[2\].
Cellular IoT is in earlier 3GPP releases also referred to as Machine
Type Communication (MTC) (see clause 4.3.17 of TS 23.401 \[26\]). The
specific functionality is described in the affected procedures and
features of this specification, in TS 23.502 \[3\], TS 23.503 \[45\] and
other specifications.

In this Release Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisations (clause 5.31.4) and
User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisations (clause 5.31.18) are only supported
over E-UTRA and these CIoT 5GS optimisations are not supported over
Non-3GPP RAT type accesses.

CIoT functionality is provided by the visited and home networks when the
networks are configured to support CIoT. It applies to both the
non-roaming case and the roaming case and some functionality may be
dependent upon the existence of appropriate roaming agreements between
the operators.

Some of the CIoT functions are controlled by subscriber data. Other CIoT
functions are based on indicators sent by the UE to the network. CIoT
functionality is performed by UEs that are configured to support
different options as described in clause 5.31.2

Though motivated by scenarios and use cases defined in TS 22.261 \[2\],
the functions added to support CIoT have general applicability and are
in no way constrained to any specific scenario, use case or UE types,
except where explicitly stated.

In the context of CIoT the term AF denotes an SCS/AS as defined
TS 23.682 \[36\].

### 5.31.2 Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour

At registration, a UE includes its 5G Preferred Network Behaviour
indicating the network behaviour the UE can support and what it would
prefer to use.

NOTE: If the UE supports S1-mode then the UE will indicate the supported
EPS Network Behaviour Information in the S1 UE network capability IE.

The 5G Preferred Network Behaviour signalled by the UE includes the
following information in the 5GMM Capability IE:

\- Whether Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.

\- Whether User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.

\- Whether N3 data transfer is supported.

\- Whether header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is
supported.

And the following 5G Preferred Network Behaviour in other IEs:

\- Whether Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation or User Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation is preferred.

If N3 data transfer is supported is indicated by the UE, the UE supports
data transfer that is not subject to CIoT 5GS Optimisations. If the UE
indicates support of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation then it shall also
indicate support of N3 data transfer.

The AMF indicates the network behaviour the network accepts in the 5G
Supported Network Behaviour information. This indication is per
Registered Area. The AMF may indicate one or more of the following:

\- Whether Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.

\- Whether User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.

\- Whether N3 data transfer is supported.

\- Whether header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is
supported.

If the AMF indicates support of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation then it
shall also indicate support of N3 data transfer. If the UE and AMF
indicate support for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF indicates
support of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation support for the UE to
NG-RAN.

For NB-IoT UEs that only support Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation,
the AMF shall include support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in
the Registration Accept message.

A UE that supports the NB-IoT shall always indicate support for Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.

A UE that supports WB-E-UTRA shall always indicate support for N3 data
transfer.

The 5G Preferred Network Behaviour indication from the UE may be used to
influence policy decisions that can cause rerouting of the Registration
Request from an AMF to another AMF.

### 5.31.3 Selection, steering and redirection between EPS and 5GS

The UE selects the core network type (EPC or 5GC) based on the broadcast
indications for both EPC and 5GC, and the UE\'s EPC and 5GC Preferred
Network Behaviour. Networks that support NB-IoT shall broadcast an
indication whether N3 data transfer is supported or not in system
information.

When the UE performs the registration procedure it includes its
Preferred Network Behaviour (for 5G and EPC) in the Registration Request
message and the AMF replies with the 5G Supported Network Behaviour in
the Registration Accept message.

If the UE supports any of the CIoT 5GS Optimisations included in 5GC
Preferred Network Behaviour, then when the UE performs an Attach or TAU
procedure and the UE includes its EPC Preferred Network Behaviour then
the UE shall also include its 5GC Preferred Network Behaviour.

In networks that support CIoT features in both EPC and 5GC, the operator
may steer UEs from a specific CN type due to operator policy, e.g. due
to roaming agreements, Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour, load
redistribution, etc. Operator policies in EPC and 5GC are assumed to
avoid steering UEs back and forth between EPC and 5GC.

To redirect a UE from 5GC to EPC, when the UE sends a Registration
Request or Service Request, the AMF sends a Registration Reject or
Service Reject with an EMM cause value indicating that the UE should not
use 5GC. The UE disables N1 mode and re-enables S1 mode, if it was
disabled. The UE then performs either an Attach or TAU in EPC as
described in clause 5.17.2.

To redirect a UE from EPC to 5GC, when the UE requests an Attach or TAU
procedure or Service Reject, the MME sends a reject message with an EMM
cause indicating the UE should not use EPC. The UE disables S1 mode and
re-enables N1 mode, if it was disabled. The UE then registers with 5GC
as described in clause 5.17.2.

When determining whether to redirect the UE, the AMF/MME takes into
account the UE support of S1/N1 mode, respectively, and the UE\'s
Preferred Network Behaviour and the Supported Network Behaviour of the
network the UE is being redirected towards.

When determining to redirect the UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode to EPC, the
AMF shall initiate the UE Configuration Update procedure to indicate
registration requested and release of the N1 NAS signalling connection
not requested, then the AMF redirects the UE to EPC by rejecting the
subsequent Registration Request, see TS 24.501 \[47\].

If after redirection the UE cannot find a cell supporting connectivity,
the UE may re-enable the disabled N1/S1 mode and then perform
Registration, Attach or TAU.

### 5.31.4 Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation

#### 5.31.4.1 General

The Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is used to exchange user data
between the UE and the SMF as payload of a NAS message in both uplink
and downlink directions, avoiding the establishment of a user plane
connection for the PDU Session. The UE and the AMF perform integrity
protection and ciphering for the user data by using NAS PDU integrity
protection and ciphering. For IP and Ethernet data, the UE and the SMF
may negotiate and perform header compression.

NOTE: In the context of Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, established
or activated user plane resources/connection refers to radio user plane
resources/connection i.e Data Radio Bearer and N3 tunnel.

UE and AMF negotiate support and use of Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation as defined in clause 5.31.2. When the Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation feature is used and the PDU Session Type is
unstructured, the SMF selects either NEF or UPF based on information in
the UE\'s subscription.

If UE and network have negotiated support and use of Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation then the following paragraphs of this clause apply.

During the PDU Session Establishment procedure the AMF indicates to the
SMF that Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is available for data
transmission.

During the PDU Session Establishment procedure the AMF also determines
based on Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2),
subscription data, other already established PDU Sessions and local
policy whether a new PDU Session shall only use the Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation (i.e. that a user-plane connection shall never be
established for the new PDU Session). If a PDU Session shall only use
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF provides a Control Plane
Only Indicator to the SMF during the PDU Session Establishment. The SMF
provides the Control Plane Only Indicator in the Session Management
Request to the UE. A UE and SMF receiving the Control Plane Only
Indicator for a PDU Session shall always use the Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation for this PDU Session.

The following rules apply for the use of the Control Plane Only
Indicator during PDU Session Establishment:

\- If N3 data transfer was not successfully negotiated, all PDU Sessions
shall include Control Plane Only Indicator.

\- If N3 data transfer was successfully negotiated then:

\- For a new PDU Session for a DNN/S-NSSAI for which the subscription
data for SMF Selection includes an Invoke NEF indication (i.e. for a PDU
Session which will be anchored in NEF), the AMF shall always include the
Control Plane Only Indicator.

\- For a new PDU Session for a DNN/S-NSSAI for which the subscription
data for SMF Selection does not include an Invoke NEF indication (i.e.
for a PDU Session which will be anchored in UPF) and that supports
interworking with EPS based on the subscription data defined in
TS 23.502 \[3\]:

\- for the first PDU Session the AMF determines based on local policy
whether to include the Control Plane Only Indicator or not;

\- if the AMF previously included a Control Plane Only Indicator for PDU
Sessions that support interworking with EPS based on the subscription
data defined in TS 23.502 \[3\] and that are anchored in UPF, the AMF
shall include it also for the new PDU Session;

\- if the AMF previously did not include a Control Plane Only Indicator
for any of the PDU Sessions that support interworking with EPS based on
the subscription data defined in TS 23.502 \[3\] and that are anchored
in UPF, the AMF shall not include it for the new PDU Session.

\- For a new PDU Session for a DNN/S-NSSAI for which the subscription
data for SMF Selection does not include an Invoke NEF indication (i.e.
for a PDU Session which will be anchored in UPF) and that does not
support interworking with EPS based on the subscription data defined in
TS 23.502 \[3\], AMF determines individually per PDU Session whether to
include the Control Plane Only Indicator or not.

As described in clause 5.31.4.2, if UE and AMF successfully negotiate N3
data transfer in addition to Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the UE
or SMF may request to establish N3 data transfer for one or more PDU
Sessions for which Control Plane Only Indicator was not received. In
CM-CONNECTED, the UE and the network use N3 delivery for PDU Sessions
for which user plane resources are established, and uses NAS for data
transmission for PDU Sessions for which user plane resources are not
established.

If the AMF determines that Control Plane Only indication associated with
PDU Session is not applicable any longer due to e.g. change of Preferred
and Supported Network Behaviour, subscription data, and local policy,
the AMF should request the SMF to release the PDU Session as specified
in clause 4.3.4.2 or clause 4.3.4.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Early Data Transmission may be initiated by the UE for mobile originated
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation when the RAT Type is E-UTRA.

The QoS model as defined in clause 5.7 is not supported for PDU Sessions
using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as user plane resources are
not established for those PDU Sessions.

#### 5.31.4.2 Establishment of N3 data transfer during Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation

If UE and AMF have successfully negotiated N3 data transfer in addition
to Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on the Preferred and
Supported Network Behaviour as defined in clause 5.31.2, then the SMF
may decide to establish N3 data transfer for any PDU session for which
Control Plane Only Indicator was not included based on local SMF
decision e.g. based on the amount of data transferred in UL or DL using
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. In that case, the SMF initiates the
SMF-triggered N3 data transfer establishment procedure as described in
clause 4.2.10.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

If UE and AMF successfully negotiate N3 data transfer in addition to
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on the Preferred and Supported
Network Behaviour as defined in clause 5.31.2, then the UE may decide to
establish N3 data transfer for any PDU session for which Control Plane
Only Indicator was not included based on local decision, e.g. based on
the amount of data to be transferred. In that case, the UE performs the
UE triggered N3 data transfer establishment procedure as described in
clause 4.2.10.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 5.31.4.3 Control Plane Relocation Indication procedure

For intra-NB-IoT mobility when UE and AMF are using Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation, the CP Relocation Indication procedures may be used.
The purpose of the CP Relocation Indication procedure is to request the
AMF to authenticate the UE\'s re-establishment request (see
TS 33.501 \[29\]), and initiate the establishment of the UE\'s N2
connection after the UE has initiated an RRC Re-Establishment procedure
in a new NG-RAN node (see TS 38.300 \[27\]).

The RRC Re-Establishment procedure uses the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI as the
UE identifier. The NG-RAN is configured with the sizes of the components
of the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI and it is configured with how to recreate the
AMF Set ID, the AMF Pointer and 5G-TMSI from the equivalent truncated
parameters (see TS 23.003 \[19\]).

The AMF configures the UE with the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI Configuration
that provides the sizes of the components of the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI as
described in TS 24.501 \[47\] during the Registration. The configuration
of these parameters are specific to each PLMN.

NOTE: Network sharing default configuration of the sizes of the
truncated components is described in TS 23.003 \[19\].

### 5.31.5 Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD)

Functions for NIDD may be used to handle Mobile Originated (MO) and
Mobile Terminated (MT) communication for unstructured data (also
referred to as Non-IP). Such delivery to the AF is accomplished by one
of the following two mechanisms:

\- Delivery using the NIDD API;

\- Delivery using UPF via a Point-to-Point (PtP) N6 tunnel.

NIDD is handled using an Unstructured PDU session to the NEF. The UE may
obtain an Unstructured PDU session to the NEF during the PDU Session
Establishment procedure. Whether or not the NIDD API shall be invoked
for a PDU session is determined by the presence of a \"NEF Identity for
NIDD\" for the DNN/S-NSSAI combination in the subscription. If the
subscription includes a \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" corresponding with the
DNN and S-NSSAI information, then the SMF selects that NEF and uses the
NIDD API for that PDU session.

The NEF exposes the NIDD APIs described in TS 23.502 \[3\] on the
N33/Nnef reference point.

The NEF uses the provisioned policies to map an AF Identifier and UE
Identity to a DNN/S-NSSAI combination if the Reliable Data Service (RDS)
is not enabled. If RDS is enabled, the NEF determines the association
based on RDS port numbers and the provisioned policies that may be used
to map AF Identifier and User identity to a DNN.

The NEF also supports distribution of Mobile Terminated messages to a
group of UEs based on the NIDD API. If an External Group Identifier is
included in the MT NIDD request, the NEF uses the UDM to resolve the
External Group Identifier to a list of SUPIs and sends the message to
each UE in the group with an established PDU Session.

The Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) may be used to transfer NIDD
parameters to and from the UE (e.g. maximum packet size). The PCO is
sent in the 5GSM signalling between UE and SMF. NIDD parameters are sent
to and from the NEF via the N29 interface.

### 5.31.6 Reliable Data Service

The Reliable Data Service (RDS) may be used between the UE and NEF or
UPF when using a PDU Session of PDU Type \'Unstructured\'. The service
provides a mechanism for the NEF or UPF to determine if the data was
successfully delivered to the UE and for the UE to determine if the data
was successfully delivered to the NEF or UPF. When a requested
acknowledgement is not received, the Reliable Data Service retransmits
the packet. The service is enabled or disabled based on DNN and NSSAI
Configuration per SLA.

When the service is enabled, a protocol is used between the end-points
of the unstructured PDU Session. The protocol uses a packet header to
identify if the packet requires no acknowledgement, requires an
acknowledgement, or is an acknowledgment and to allow detection and
elimination of duplicate PDUs at the receiving endpoint. RDS supports
both single and multiple applications within the UE. Port Numbers in the
header are used to identify the application on the originator and to
identify the application on the receiver. The UE, NEF and the UPF may
support reservation of the source and destination port numbers for their
use and subsequent release of the reserved port numbers. Reliable Data
Service protocol (as defined in TS 24.250 \[80\]) also enables
applications to query their peer entities to determine which port
numbers are reserved and which are available for use at any given time.
The header is configured based on Reliable Data Service Configuration
information which is obtained in the NIDD configuration, MT NIDD, and MO
NIDD procedures with the AF as specified in TS 23.502 \[3\].

During NIDD Configuration, the AF may indicate which serialization
formats it supports for mobile originated and mobile terminated traffic
in the Reliable Data Server Configuration. When port numbers are
reserved by the UE, the serialization format that will be used by the
application may be indicated to the NEF. When port numbers are reserved
by the NEF, the serialization format that will be used by the
application may be indicated to the UE. If the receiver does not support
the indicated serialization format, it rejects the port number
reservation request and the sender may re-attempt to reserve the port
number with a different serialization format. If, during NIDD
Configuration, the AF indicated that it supports multiple serialization
formats, the NEF determines the serialization format that it will
indicate to the UE based on local policies and previous negotiations
with the UE (e.g. the NEF may indicate the same serialization format
that was indicated by the UE or avoid indicating a serialization format
that was previously rejected by the UE). When serialization formats are
configured for reserved port numbers, the NEF stores the serialization
formats as part of the Reliable Data Service Configuration and provides
the updated Reliable Data Service Configuration to the AF.

NOTE: Whether the UE Application or AF supports a given serialization
format is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.

The UE indicates its capability of supporting RDS in the Protocol
Configuration Options (PCO) and the SMF negotiates RDS support with the
NEF or UPF. If the NEF or UPF supports and accepts RDS then the SMF
indicates to the UE, in the PCO, that the RDS shall be used if enabled
in the DNN and NSSAI configuration.

In order to prevent situations where an RDS instance needs to interface
to both the user and control plane, RDS may only be used with PDU
Sessions for which the \"Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation\"
indication is set or with PDU sessions using the Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation when the AMF does not move the PDU session to the user
plane.

Reliable Data Service protocol is defined in TS 24.250 \[80\].

### 5.31.7 Power Saving Enhancements

#### 5.31.7.1 General

To enable UE power saving and to enhance MT reachability while using
MICO mode, e.g. for CIoT, the following features are specified in the
following clauses:

\- Extended Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for CM-IDLE and CM-CONNECTED
with RRC-INACTIVE;

\- MICO mode with Extended Connected Time;

\- MICO mode with Active Time;

\- MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control.

If a UE requests via NAS to enable both MICO mode with Active Time and
extended idle mode DRX, e.g. based on local configuration, Expected UE
Behaviour, if available, UE requested Active Time value, UE subscription
information and network policies etc, the AMF may decide to enable MICO
mode with or without Active Time, extended idle mode DRX or both.

#### 5.31.7.2 Extended Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for CM-IDLE and CM-CONNECTED with RRC-INACTIVE

##### 5.31.7.2.1 Overview

The UE and the network may negotiate over non-access stratum signalling
the use of extended idle mode DRX for reducing its power consumption,
while being available for mobile terminating data and/or network
originated procedures within a certain delay dependent on the DRX cycle
value. Extended DRX in CM-IDLE is supported for E-UTRA and NR connected
to 5GC. Extended DRX in CM-CONNECTED with RRC-Inactive mode is supported
for WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M and NR connected to 5GC. RRC-Inactive is not
supported by NB-IoT connected to 5GC.

The negotiation of the eDRX parameters for NR, WB-E-UTRA and LTE-M is
supported over any RAT.

Applications that want to use extended idle mode DRX need to consider
specific handling of mobile terminating services or data transfers, and
in particular they need to consider the delay tolerance of mobile
terminated data. A network side application may send mobile terminated
data, an SMS, or a device trigger, and needs to be aware that extended
idle mode DRX may be in place. A UE should request for extended idle
mode DRX only when all expected mobile terminating communication is
tolerant to delay.

NOTE 1: The extended idle mode DRX cycle length requested by UE takes
into account requirements of applications running on the UE.
Subscription based determination of eDRX cycle length can be used in
those rare scenarios when applications on UE cannot be modified to
request appropriate extended idle mode DRX cycle length. The network
accepting extended DRX while providing an extended idle mode DRX cycle
length value longer than the one requested by the UE, can adversely
impact reachability requirements of applications running on the UE.

UE and NW negotiate the use of extended idle mode DRX as follows:

If the UE decides to request for extended idle mode DRX, the UE includes
an extended idle mode DRX parameters information element in the
Registration Request message. The UE may also include the UE specific
DRX parameters information element for regular idle mode DRX according
to clause 5.4.5. The extended DRX parameters information element
includes the extended idle mode DRX cycle length.

The AMF decides whether to accept or reject the UE request for enabling
extended idle mode DRX. If the AMF accepts the extended idle mode DRX,
the AMF based on operator policies and, if available, the extended idle
mode DRX cycle length value in the subscription data from the UDM, may
also provide different values of the extended idle mode DRX parameters
than what was requested by the UE. The AMF taking into account the RAT
specific Subscribed Paging Time Window, the UE\'s current RAT and local
policy also assigns a Paging Time Window length to be used, and provides
this value to the UE during Registration Update procedures together with
the extended idle mode DRX cycle length in the extended DRX parameter
information element. If the AMF accepts the use of extended idle mode
DRX, the UE shall apply extended idle mode DRX based on the received
extended idle mode DRX length, the UE\'s current RAT (NR, NB-IoT,
WB-E-UTRA or LTE-M) and RAT specific Paging Time Window length. If the
UE does not receive the extended DRX parameters information element in
the relevant accept message because the AMF rejected its request or
because the request was received by AMF not supporting extended idle
mode DRX, the UE shall apply its regular discontinuous reception as
defined in clause 5.4.5. For NR, Paging Time Window applies for extended
DRX lengths greater than 10.24s as defined in TS 38.304 \[50\]. For
WB-E-UTRA, Paging Time Window applies for extended DRX lengths of 10.24s
and greater as defined in TS 36.304 \[52\].

When the UE is accessing NR, if the AMF provides an extended idle mode
DRX cycle length value of 10.24s, and the registration area of the UE
contains only NR cells, the AMF does not include a Paging Time Window.
If the AMF provides an extended idle mode DRX cycle length value of
10.24s, and the registration area of the UE contains E-UTRA cells and NR
cells if the UE supports both E-UTRA and NR, the AMF includes a Paging
Time Window.

For WB-E-UTRA and LTE-M the eNB broadcasts an indicator for support of
extended idle mode DRX in 5GC in addition to the existing indicator for
support of extended idle mode DRX in EPC as defined in TS 36.331 \[51\].
For NR the gNB broadcasts an indicator for support of extended idle mode
DRX as defined in TS 38.331 \[28\]. This indicator is used by the UE in
CM-IDLE state.

NOTE 2: A broadcast indicator for support of extended idle mode DRX is
not needed for NB-IoT as it is always supported in NB-IoT.

The specific negotiation procedure handling is described in
TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 3: If the Periodic Registration Update timer assigned to the UE is
not longer than the extended idle mode DRX cycle the power savings are
not maximised.

For RAT types that support extended DRX for CM-CONNECTED with RRC
Inactive state, the AMF passes the UE\'s accepted idle mode eDRX cycle
length value to NG-RAN. If the UE supports eDRX in RRC inactive, based
on its UE radio capabilities, NG-RAN configures the UE with an eDRX
cycle in RRC-INACTIVE up to the value for the UE\'s idle mode eDRX cycle
as provided by the AMF in \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\" as
defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 or up to 10.24 seconds (whichever is lower).

If eDRX cycle is applied in RRC-INACTIVE, the RAN buffers DL packets up
to the duration of the eDRX cycle chosen by NG-RAN.

When the UE has PDU Session associated with emergency services, the UE
and AMF follow regular discontinuous reception as defined in
clause 5.4.5 and shall not use the extended idle mode DRX. Extended idle
mode DRX parameters may be negotiated while the UE has PDU Session
associated with emergency services. When the PDU Session associated with
emergency services is released, the UE and AMF shall reuse the
negotiated extended idle mode DRX parameters in the last Registration
Update procedure.

The UE shall include the extended DRX parameters information element in
each Registration Request message if it still wants to use extended idle
mode DRX. At AMF to AMF, AMF to MME and MME to AMF mobility, the
extended idle mode DRX parameters are not sent from the old CN node to
the new CN node as part of the MM context information.

##### 5.31.7.2.2 Paging for extended idle mode DRX in E-UTRA and NR connected to 5GC

##### 5.31.7.2.2.0 General {#general-80 .H6}

For WB-E-UTRA and LTE-M connected to 5GC, the extended idle mode DRX
value range will consist of values starting from 5.12s (i.e. 5.12s,
10.24s, 20.48s, etc.) up to a maximum of 2621.44s (almost 44 min). For
NB-IoT, the extended idle mode DRX value range will start from 20.48s
(i.e. 20.48s, 40.96s, 81.92, etc.) up to a maximum of 10485.76s (almost
3 hours) (see TS 36.304 \[52\]). For NR, the extended idle mode DRX
value range will consist of values starting from 2.56s (i.e. 2.56s,
5.12s, 10.24s, 20.48s, etc.) up to a maximum of 10485.76s (almost 3
hours) (see TS 38.304 \[50\]). The extended idle mode DRX cycle length
is negotiated via NAS signalling. The AMF includes the extended idle
mode DRX cycle length for NR, WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M or NB-IoT in paging
message to assist the NG-RAN node in paging the UE. For NR, Paging Time
Window applies for extended DRX lengths greater than 10.24s as defined
in TS 38.304 \[50\].

For extended idle mode DRX cycle length of 5.12s, the network follows
the regular paging strategy as defined in clause 5.4.5.

For extended idle mode DRX cycle length of 10.24s or longer, clauses
5.31.7.2.2.1, 5.31.7.2.2.2 and 5.31.7.2.2.3 apply.

##### 5.31.7.2.2.1 Hyper SFN, Paging Hyperframe and Paging Time Window length {#hyper-sfn-paging-hyperframe-and-paging-time-window-length .H6}

A Hyper-SFN (H-SFN) frame structure is defined on top of the SFN used
for regular idle mode DRX. Each H-SFN value corresponds to a cycle of
the legacy SFN of 1024 radio frames, i.e. 10.24s. When extended idle
mode DRX is enabled for a UE, the UE is reachable for paging in specific
Paging Hyperframes (PH), which is a specific set of H-SFN values. The PH
computation is a formula that is function of the extended idle mode DRX
cycle, and a UE specific identifier, as described in TS 36.304 \[52\]
and TS 38.304 \[50\]. This value can be computed at all UEs and AMFs
without need for signalling. The AMF includes the extended idle mode DRX
cycle length and the PTW length in paging message to assist the NG-RAN
nodes in paging the UE.

The AMF also assigns a Paging Time Window length, and provides this
value to the UE during Registration Update procedures together with the
extended idle mode DRX cycle length. The UE first paging occasion is
within the Paging Hyperframe as described in TS 36.304 \[52\] and
TS 38.304 \[50\]. The UE is assumed reachable for paging within the
Paging Time Window. The start and end of the Paging Time Window is
described in TS 36.304 \[52\] and TS 38.304 \[50\]. After the Paging
Time Window length, the AMF considers the UE unreachable for paging
until the next Paging Hyperfame.

##### 5.31.7.2.2.2 Loose Hyper SFN synchronization {#loose-hyper-sfn-synchronization .H6}

NOTE: This clause applies for extended DRX cycle lengths of 10.24s or
longer.

In order for the UE to be paged at roughly similar time, the H-SFN of
all NG-RAN nodes and AMFs should be loosely synchronized.

Each NG-RAN node and AMF synchronizes internally the H-SFN counter so
that the start of H-SFN=0 coincides with the same a preconfigured time
epoch. If NG-RAN nodes and AMFs use different epochs, e.g. due to the
use of different time references, the GPS time should be set as the
baseline, and the NG-RAN nodes and AMFs synchronize the H-SFN counter
based on the GPS epoch considering the time offset between GPS epoch and
other time-reference epoch a preconfigured time. It is assumed that
NG-RAN nodes and AMFs are able to use the same H-SFN value with accuracy
in the order of legacy DRX cycle lengths, e.g. 1 to 2 seconds. There is
no need for synchronization at SFN level.

There is no signalling between network nodes required to achieve this
level of loose H-SFN synchronization.

##### 5.31.7.2.2.3 AMF paging and paging retransmission strategy {#amf-paging-and-paging-retransmission-strategy .H6}

NOTE: This clause applies for extended DRX cycle lengths of 10.24s or
longer.

When the AMF receives trigger for paging and the UE is reachable for
paging, the AMF sends the paging request. If the UE is not reachable for
paging, then the AMF pages the UE just before the next paging occasion.

The AMF determines the Paging Time Window length and a paging
retransmission strategy, and executes the retransmission scheme.

For extended DRX length of 10.24s, in the paging request message the AMF
sends the Paging Time Window to the ng-eNB but does not send the Paging
Time Window to the gNB.

##### 5.31.7.2.3 Paging for a UE registered in a tracking area with heterogeneous support of extended idle mode DRX

When the UE is registered in a registration area with heterogeneous
support of extended idle mode DRX (e.g. comprising WB-E-UTRA and NR
cells) and has negotiated eDRX, the AMF shall, for any paging procedure,
perform at least one paging attempt during a PTW.

NOTE: Heterogeneous support of extended idle mode DRX in tracking areas
assigned by AMF in a TAI list can result in significant battery life
reduction in the UE as compared to homogeneous support by NG-RAN nodes
of extended idle mode DRX.

#### 5.31.7.3 MICO mode with Extended Connected Time

When a UE, using MICO mode, initiates MO signalling or MO data and the
AMF is aware of pending or expected MT traffic, the AMF may keep the UE
in CM-CONNECTED state and the RAN may keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state
for an Extended Connected Time period in order to ensure the downlink
data and/or signalling is delivered to the UE. The Extended Connected
Time is determined by the AMF and is based on local configuration and/or
the Maximum Response Time, if provided by the UDM.

The AMF maintains the N2 connection for at least the Extended Connected
Time and provides the Extended Connected Time value to the RAN. The
Extended Connected Time value indicates the minimum time the RAN should
keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state regardless of inactivity. The
Extended Connected Time value is provided to the RAN together with the

\- NAS Registration Accept message; or

\- NAS Service Accept message.

At inter-RAN node handovers, if some signalling or data are still
pending, the target AMF may send the Extended Connected Time value to
the target RAN node.

#### 5.31.7.4 MICO mode with Active Time

During a Registration procedure the UE may optionally request an Active
Time value from the AMF as part of MICO Mode negotiation. In response,
if the AMF receives an Active Time value from the UE and determines that
the MICO mode is allowed for the UE, the AMF may assign an Active Time
value for the UE, e.g. based on local configuration, Expected UE
Behaviour if available, UE requested Active Time value, UE subscription
information and network policies, and indicates it to the UE during
Registration procedure. When an Active Time value is assigned to the UE
the AMF shall consider the UE reachable for paging after the transition
from CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE for the duration of the Active Time.
Together with the Active Time value, the UE may request a periodic
registration time value as specified in clause 5.31.7.45.

When the AMF indicates MICO mode with an Active Time to a UE, the
registration area may be constrained by paging area size. To avoid
paging in the entire PLMN, when the AMF allocates the Active Time the
AMF should not allocate \"all PLMN\" registration area to the UE.

The UE and AMF shall set a timer corresponding to the Active Time value
negotiated during the most recent Registration procedure. The UE and AMF
shall start the timer upon entering CM-IDLE state from CM-CONNECTED.
When the timer expires (i.e. reaches the Active Time) the UE enters MICO
mode and the AMF can deduce that the UE has entered MICO mode and is not
available for paging. If the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state before the
timer expires, the UE and AMF shall stop and reset the timer.

If no Active Time value was negotiated during the most recent
Registration procedure the UE shall not start the timer and it shall
instead enter MICO mode directly upon entering CM-IDLE state.

Active Time is not transferred between AMF and MME.

#### 5.31.7.5 MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control

If the Expected UE Behaviour indicates the absence of DL communication,
the AMF may allow MICO mode for the UE and allocate a large periodic
registration timer value based on e.g. Network Configuration parameters
to the UE so that the UE can maximise power saving between Periodic
Registration Updates.

If the Expected UE Behaviour indicates scheduled DL communication the
AMF should allow MICO mode for the UE and allocate a periodic
registration timer value such that the UE performs Periodic Registration
Update to renegotiate MICO mode before or at the scheduled DL
communication time, if the AMF decides to allow MICO mode for the UE.
When UE requests the MICO mode with active time, the UE may also request
a periodic registration timer value suitable for the
latency/responsiveness of the DL communication service known to UE. If
the UE wants to change the periodic registration timer value, e.g. when
the conditions are changed in the UE, the UE consequently requests the
value it wants in the registration procedure. The AMF takes the UE
requested periodic registration time value into consideration when
providing the periodic registration timer to UE during Registration
procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

If the UE supports \'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication\',
the UE indicates its capability of supporting \'Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication\' in the Registration Request message. If
the UE indicates its support of \'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer
Indication\' in the Registration Request message, the AMF may provide a
Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication to the UE together with
the periodic registration timer value, e.g. based on Expected UE
Behaviour. If the indication is provided by the AMF, the UE and the AMF
shall start the periodic registration timer after completion of the
Registration procedure. The UE and the AMF shall neither stop nor
restart the periodic registration timer when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED,
and shall keep it running while in CM-CONNECTED state and after
returning to CM-IDLE state. If and only when the timer expires and the
UE is in CM-IDLE, the UE shall perform a Periodic Registration Update.
If the timer expires and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF and
the UE restart the periodic registration timer while still applying
\'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication\'. The AMF may use the
UE Configuration Update procedure to trigger the UE to perform
Registration procedure, in which the periodic registration timer value
and \'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication\' can be
renegotiated.

When the UE and the AMF locally disable MICO mode (e.g. when an
emergency service is initiated), the UE and the AMF shall not apply
\'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication\'.

If the periodic registration timer is renegotiated during a Registration
procedure, e.g. triggered by UE Configuration Update, and if the
periodic registration timer is running, then the periodic registration
timer is stopped and restarted using the renegotiated value even when
the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication was provided to the
UE.

### 5.31.8 High latency communication

Functions for High latency communication may be used to handle mobile
terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while using
power saving functions as specified in clause 5.31.7. \"High latency\"
refers to the initial response time before normal exchange of packets is
established. That is, the time it takes before a UE has woken up from
its power saving state and responded to an initial downlink packet or
signal.

When a NR RedCap UE requests to use the power saving functions as
specified in clause 5.31.7, then the AMF may, based on local policy,
reroute the Registration Request to another AMF that supports High
latency communication as specified in clause 6.3.5.

High latency communication is supported by extended buffering of
downlink data in the UPF, SMF or NEF when a UE is using power saving
functions in CM-IDLE state and the UE is not reachable. For UPF anchored
PDU sessions the SMF configures during AN release the UPF with user data
Forwarding Action Rule and user data Buffering Action Rule according to
TS 29.244 \[65\]. The rules include instructions whether UPF buffering
applies or the user data shall be forwarded to the SMF for buffering in
the SMF. For NEF anchored PDU sessions only extended buffering in the
NEF is supported in this release of the specification. During the
Network Triggered Service Request procedure or Mobile Terminated Data
Transport procedures when using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the
AMF provides an Estimated Maximum Wait Time to the SMF if the SMF
indicates the support of extended buffering. The SMF determines the
Extended Buffering Time based on the received Estimated Maximum Wait
Time or local configuration. The handling is e.g. specified in the
Network Triggered Service Request procedure, clauses 4.2.3.3, 4.2.6,
4.24.2 and 4.25.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

High latency communication is also supported through notification
procedures. The following procedures are available based on different
monitoring events:

\- UE Reachability;

\- Availability after DDN failure;

\- Downlink Data Delivery Status.

An AF may request a one-time \"UE Reachability\" notification when it
wants to send data to a UE which is using a power saving function (see
event subscription procedure in clause 4.15.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]). The
SCS/AS/AF then waits with sending the data until it gets a notification
that the UE is reachable (see notification procedures in
TS 23.502 \[3\]).

An AF may request repeated \"Availability after DDN failure\"
notifications where each UE reachability notification is triggered by a
preceding DDN failure, i.e. the AF sends a downlink packet to request a
UE reachability notification when the UE becomes reachable. That
downlink packet is discarded by the UPF or SMF or NEF (see notification
procedures in TS 23.502 \[3\]).

An AF may request repeated \"Downlink Data Delivery Status\"
notifications when it wants indications that DL data has been buffered
or when buffered DL data has been delivered to the UE.

If MICO mode or extended idle mode DRX is enabled, Idle Status
Indication allows the AF to determine when the UE transitions into idle
mode. When requesting to be informed of either \"UE Reachability\" or
\"Availability after DDN failure\" notification, the AF may also request
Idle Status Indication. If the UDM and the AMF support Idle Status
Indication, then when the UE for which MICO mode or extended idle mode
DRX is enabled transitions into idle mode, the AMF includes in the
notification towards the NEF the time at which the UE transitioned into
idle mode, the active time and the periodic registration update timer
granted to the UE by the AMF, the eDRX cycle length and the Suggested
number of downlink packets if a value was provided to the SMF.

An AF may provide parameters related to High latency communication for
different methods to UDM, via NEF, as part of provisioning capability as
specified in clause 5.20. The UDM can further deliver the parameters to
other NFs (e.g. AMF or SMF) as specified in clause 4.15.6 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

If the AMF is aware that some signalling or data is pending in the
network for an UE that is known as being unreachable for a long
duration, e.g. for UE\'s having extended idle mode DRX or MICO enabled,
the AMF maintains the N2 connection for at least the Extended Connected
Time and provides the Extended Connected Time value in a NG-AP message
to the RAN. The Extended Connected Time value indicates the minimum time
the RAN should keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state regardless of
inactivity. At inter-RAN node handovers, if some signalling or data are
still pending, the target AMF may send the Extended Connected Time value
to the target RAN node.

### 5.31.9 Support for Monitoring Events

The Monitoring Events feature is intended for monitoring of specific
events in the 3GPP system and reporting such Monitoring Events via the
NEF. The feature allows NFs in 5GS to be configured to detect specific
events and report the events to the requested party. Clause 5.20 further
discusses the Monitoring capabilities of the NEF.

For CIoT, the list of supported monitoring events is specified in
Table 4.15.3.1-1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

Support for Monitoring Events can be offered via AMF, UDM, NSACF and
SMF, and can be reported via the NEF, as specified in clause 4.15.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.31.10 NB-IoT UE Radio Capability Handling

NB-IoT Radio Capabilities are handled in the network independently from
other RATs\' Radio Capabilities, see clause 5.4.4.1.

### 5.31.11 Inter-RAT idle mode mobility to and from NB-IoT

Tracking Areas are configured so that they do not contain both NB-IoT
and other RATs\' cells, so when the UE is changing RAT type to or from
NB-IoT while remaining registered with 5GC, the UE will perform the
Mobility Registration Update procedure, see clause 5.3.2.3. When the UE
is changing RAT type to or from NB-IoT and moving between 5GC and EPC,
during the Registration, Attach or TAU procedure the RAT type change is
determined.

The specification in this clause does not apply to RAT type
corresponding to Non-3GPP Access type.

PDU session handling is controlled by \"PDU Session continuity at inter
RAT mobility\" in the UE\'s subscription data, which indicates per
DNN/S-NSSAI whether to;

\- maintain the PDU session,

\- disconnect the PDU session with a reactivation request,

\- disconnect the PDU session without reactivation request, or

\- leave it up to local VPLMN policy

when the UE moves between a \"broadband\" RAT (e.g. NR or WB-E-UTRA) and
a \"narrowband\" RAT (NB-IoT).

During PDU session establishment the SMF retrieves the \"PDU Session
continuity at inter RAT mobility\" subscription information (if
available) from the UDM. Local SMF configuration is used if \"PDU
Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" is not available for a PDU
Session.

The AMF informs the SMF at an inter-RAT idle mobility event, e.g. to or
from NB-IoT connected to 5GC about the RAT type change in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext message during the Registration
procedure. Based on this (H-)SMF handles the PDU session according to
\"PDU session continuity at inter RAT mobility information\"
subscription data or based on local policy.

NOTE: The \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" and \"PDN
continuity at inter-RAT mobility\" subscription should be the same so
that the PDU sessions/PDN connections are handled the same by both CN
types.

During inter-RAT idle mode mobility to NB-IoT, if a PDU session has more
than one QoS rule, the SMF shall initiate a PDU session modification
procedure as described in TS 23.502 \[3\] to remove any non-default QoS
rule, and maintain only the default QoS rule.

### 5.31.12 Restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage

Support of UEs in Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 36.300 \[30\].

The usage of Enhanced Coverage requires use of extensive resources (e.g.
radio and signalling resources). Specific subscribers can be restricted
to use the Enhanced Coverage feature through Enhanced Coverage
Restricted information that is stored in the UDM as part of subscription
data and specifies per PLMN whether the Enhanced Coverage functionality
is restricted or not for the UE. For eMTC, the Enhanced Coverage
Restricted information indicates whether CE mode B is restricted for the
UE, or both CE mode A and CE mode B are restricted for the UE, or both
CE mode A and CE mode B are not restricted for the UE. For NB-IoT, the
NB-IoT Enhanced Coverage Restricted information indicates whether the
Enhanced Coverage is restricted or not for the UE.

The AMF receives Enhanced Coverage Restricted information from the UDM
during the Registration procedure. If the UE includes the support for
restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage in the Registration Request
message, the AMF based on local configuration, UE Usage setting, UE
subscription information and network policies, or any combination of
them, determines whether Enhanced Coverage is restricted for the UE and
stores updated Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE
context in the AMF. If the UE usage setting indicated that UE is \"voice
centric\", then the AMF shall set CE mode B restricted for the UE in
Enhanced Coverage Restriction information.

The AMF sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the UE in the
Registration Accept message. The UE shall use the value of Enhanced
Coverage Restricted information to determine if enhanced coverage
feature is restricted or not. The AMF provides an Enhanced Coverage
Restricted information to the RAN via N2 signalling whenever the UE
context is established in the RAN, e.g. during N2 Paging procedure,
Service Request procedure, Initial Registration and Periodic
Registration procedure.

For roaming UEs, if the UDM doesn\'t provide any Enhanced Coverage
Restricted information or the provided Enhanced Coverage Restricted
information is in conflict with the roaming agreement, the AMF uses
default Enhanced Coverage Restricted information locally configured in
the VPLMN based on the roaming agreement with the subscriber\'s HPLMN.

The UE indicates its capability of support for restriction of use of
Enhanced Coverage to the AMF in the Registration procedure for the RAT
it is camping on. A UE that supports Enhanced Coverage shall also
support restriction of the Enhanced Coverage.

The UE shall assume that restriction for use of Enhanced Coverage
indicated by Enhanced Coverage Restricted information is the same in the
equivalent PLMNs. NB-IoT cells also broadcast the support of restriction
of use of Enhanced Coverage as defined in TS 36.331 \[51\].

If the UE supports CE mode B and use of CE mode B is not restricted
according to the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE
context in the AMF, then the AMF shall use the extended NAS-MM timer
setting for the UE as specified in TS 24.501 \[47\] and shall send the
extended NAS-SM timer indication during PDU session establishment to the
SMF.

If the UE supports CE mode B and use of CE mode B changes from
restricted to unrestricted or vice versa in the Enhanced Coverage
Restriction information in the UE context in the AMF (e.g. due to a
subscription change) then:

\- The AMF determines when to enforce the change of restriction of use
of Enhanced Coverage.

\- When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF can use the UE
Configuration Update procedure, as specified in step 3a of
clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\], to trigger a mobility registration
update procedure in CM-CONNECTED mode for the AMF to inform the change
of restriction of Enhanced Coverage towards the UE.

\- If the UE has already established PDU sessions, then the AMF shall
trigger a PDU session modification to the SMFs serving the UE\'s PDU
sessions to update the use of the extended NAS-SM timer setting as
described in step 1f of clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] when the AMF
determines that NAS-SM timer shall be updated due to the change of
Enhanced Coverage Restriction.

\- The UE and network applies the new Enhanced Coverage Restriction
information after mobility registration procedure is completed.

Based on the extended NAS-SM timer indication, the SMF shall use the
extended NAS-SM timer setting for the UE as specified in
TS 24.501 \[47\].

The support for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via NEF enables AF
to query status of Enhanced Coverage Restriction or enable/disable
Enhanced Coverage Restriction per individual UEs. The procedure for
Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via NEF is described in
clause 4.27 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.31.13 Paging for Enhanced Coverage

Support of UEs in Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 36.300 \[30\].

Whenever N2 is released and Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE is
available for the UE, the NG-RAN sends it to the AMF as described in
clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AMF stores the received Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE and
then the AMF includes it in every subsequent Paging message for all
NG-RAN nodes selected by the AMF for paging.

If Enhanced Coverage is restricted for the UE as described in
clause 5.31.12, the AMF sends the Enhanced Coverage Restriction
parameter as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\].

NOTE: Only the NG-RAN node which cell ID is included in the Paging
Assistance Data considers the assistance data.

### 5.31.14 Support of rate control of user data

#### 5.31.14.1 General

The rate of user data sent to and from a UE (e.g. a UE using CIoT 5GS
Optimisations) can be controlled in two different ways:

\- Serving PLMN Rate Control;

\- Small Data Rate Control.

Serving PLMN Rate Control is intended to allow the Serving PLMN to
protect its AMF and the Signalling Radio Bearers in the NG-RAN from the
load generated by NAS Data PDUs.

Small Data Rate Control is intended to allow HPLMN operators to offer
customer services such as \"maximum of Y messages per day\".

NOTE: Existing Session-AMBR mechanisms are not suitable for such a
service since, for radio efficiency and UE battery life reasons, an AMBR
of e.g. \> 100kbit/s is desirable and such an AMBR translates to a
potentially large daily data volume.

The SMF in the Serving PLMN may send the Small Data rate control
parameter for an emergency PDU session.

#### 5.31.14.2 Serving PLMN Rate Control

The Serving PLMN Rate Control value is configured in the (V-)SMF.

NOTE 1: Homogeneous support of Serving PLMN Rate Control in a network is
assumed.

At PDU Session establishment and PDU Session modification, the (V-)SMF
may inform the UE and UPF/NEF of any per PDU Session local Serving PLMN
Rate Control that the Serving PLMN intends to enforce for NAS Data PDUs.
The (V-)SMF shall only indicate a Serving PLMN Rate Control command to
the UPF if the PDU Session is using N4 and is set to Control Plane only.
The (V-)SMF shall only indicate a Serving PLMN Rate Control command to
the NEF if that PDN connection is using NEF.

Serving PLMN rate control is operator configurable and expressed as \"X
NAS Data PDUs per deci hour\" where X is an integer that shall not be
less than 10. There are separate limits for uplink and downlink NAS Data
PDUs:

\- The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink NAS Data
PDUs to comply with the Serving PLMN policy. In the UE the indicated
rate control applies only on the PDU Session where it was received, and
therefore the UE shall limit the rate of its uplink NAS Data PDUs to
comply with the rate that is indicated for the PDU Session. The
indicated rate is valid until the PDU Session is released.

\- The UPF/NEF shall limit the rate at which it generates downlink Data
PDUs. In the UPF/NEF the indicated rate control applies only on the PDU
Session where it was received, and therefore the UPF/NEF shall limit the
rate of its downlink Data PDUs to comply with the rate that is indicated
for the PDU Session.

\- The (V-)SMF may enforce these limits per PDU Session by discarding or
delaying packets that exceed these limits. The Serving PLMN Rate does
not include SMS using NAS Transport PDUs. The (V-)SMF starts the Serving
PLMN Rate Control when the first NAS Data PDU is received.

NOTE 2: If the UE/UPF/NEF start the Serving PLMN rate control at a
different time than the (V-)SMF, PDUs sent within the limit enforced at
the UE/UPF/NEF can still exceed the limit enforced by the (V-)SMF.

NOTE 3 It is assumed that the Serving PLMN Rate is sufficiently high to
not interfere with the Small Data Rate Control as the Small Data Rate
Control, if used, is assumed to allow fewer messages. NAS PDUs related
to exception reports are not subject to the Serving PLMN Rate Control.

#### 5.31.14.3 Small Data Rate Control

The (H-)SMF may consider, e.g. based on operator policy, subscription,
DNN, S-NSSAI, RAT type etc. to determine whether to apply Small Data
Rate Control or not. The (H-)SMF can send a Small Data Uplink Rate
Control command to the UE using the PCO information element. The (H-)SMF
informs the UPF or NEF of any Small Data Rate Control that shall be
enforced.

The Small Data Rate Control applies to data PDUs sent on that PDU
Session by either Data Radio Bearers or Signalling Radio Bearers (NAS
Data PDUs).

The rate control information is separate for uplink and downlink and in
the form of:

\- an integer \'number of packets per time unit\', and

\- an integer \'number of additional allowed exception report packets
per time unit\' once the rate control limit has been reached.

The UE shall comply with this uplink rate control instruction. If the UE
exceeds the uplink \'number of packets per time unit\', the UE may still
send uplink exception reports if allowed and the \'number of additional
allowed exception reports per time unit\' has not been exceeded. The UE
shall consider this rate control instruction as valid until it receives
a new one from (H-)SMF.

When a PDU Session is first established, the (H-)SMF may provide the
configured Small Data Rate Control parameters to the UE and UPF or NEF.

When the PDU Session is released, the Small Data Rate Control Status
(including the number of packets still allowed in the given time unit,
the number of additional exception reports still allowed in the given
time unit and the termination time of the current Small Data Rate
Control validity period) may be stored in the AMF so that it can be
retrieved for a subsequent re-establishment of a new PDU Session.

At subsequent establishment of a new PDU Session, the (H-)SMF may
receive the previously stored Small Data Rate Control Status and if the
validity period has not expired, it provides the parameters to the UE in
the PCO and to the UPF/NEF as the initially applied parameters, in
addition to the configured Small Data Rate Control parameters. If the
initially applied parameters are provided, the UE and UPF or NEF shall
apply them and shall use the SMF provided configured Small Data Rate
Control parameters once the initially applied Small Data Rate Control
validity period expires.

NOTE 1: Storage of Small Data Rate Control Status information for very
long time intervals can be implementation specific.

For the UPF and NEF, Small Data Rate Control is based on a \'maximum
allowed rate\' per direction. If (H-)SMF provided the \'number of
additional allowed exception report packets per time unit\', then the
\'maximum allowed rate\' is equal to the \'number of packets per time
unit\' plus the \'number of additional allowed exception report packets
per time unit\', otherwise the \'maximum allowed rate\' is equal to the
\'number of packets per time unit\'.

The UPF or NEF may enforce the uplink rate by discarding or delaying
packets that exceed the \'maximum allowed rate\'. The UPF or NEF shall
enforce the downlink rate by discarding or delaying packets that exceed
the downlink part of the \'maximum allowed rate\'.

NOTE 2: It is assumed that the Serving PLMN Rate is sufficiently high to
not interfere with the Small Data Rate Control as the Small Data Rate
Control, if used, is assumed to allow fewer messages. NAS PDUs related
to exception reports are not subject to the Serving PLMN Rate Control.

For NB-IoT the AMF maintains an \"MO Exception Data Counter\" which is
incremented when the RRC establishment cause \"MO exception data\" is
received from NG-RAN. The AMF reports whether the UE accessed using \"MO
exception data\" RRC establishment cause, to all (H-)SMFs which have PDU
Sessions that are subject to Small Data Rate Control and if the UE is
accessing using \"MO exception data\" then the \"MO Exception Data
Counter\" is also provided by the AMF. The SMF indicates each use of the
RRC establishment cause \"MO Exception Data\" by including the related
counter on the charging information.

NOTE 3: Since Exception Data PDUs and normal priority PDUs cannot be
distinguished within an RRC connection, the AMF is only counting the
number of RRC Connection establishments with \"MO Exception data\"
priority.

If the UE moves to EPC then the UE and the PGW-U+UPF store the current
Small Data Rate Control Status for all PDU Sessions that are not
released. If the UE moves back to 5GC the stored Small Data Rate Control
Status is restored and continues to apply to PDU Session(s) that are
moved from EPC to 5GC, taking into account remaining validity period of
the stored Small Data Rate Control Status. When the UE moves to EPC the
Small Data Rate Control Status for all PDU Session(s) may also be stored
in the AMF if the PDU Session is released while the UE is connected to
EPC and re-established when the UE moves to 5GC. The time to store the
Small Data Rate Control Status information is implementation specific.

### 5.31.15 Control Plane Data Transfer Congestion Control

NAS level congestion control may be applied in general for all NAS
messages. To enable congestion control for control plane data transfer,
a Control Plane data back-off timer is used, see clause 5.19.7.6.

### 5.31.16 Service Gap Control

Service Gap Control is an optional feature intended for CIoT UEs to
control the frequency at which these UEs can access the network. That
is, to ensure a minimum time gap between consecutive Mobile Originated
data communications initiated by the UE. This helps reducing peak load
situations when there are a large number of these UEs in an operator
network. Service Gap Control is intended to be used for \"small data
allowance plans\" for MTC/CIoT UEs where the applications are tolerant
to service latency.

NOTE 1: Time critical applications, such as regulatory prioritized
services like Emergency services can suffer from the latency caused by
the Service Gap Control feature. Therefore Service Gap Control feature
is not recommended for subscriptions with such applications and
services.

Service Gap Time is a subscription parameter used to set the Service Gap
timer and is enforced in the UE and in the AMF on a per UE level (i.e.
the same Service Gap Timer applies for all PDU Sessions that the UE
has). The UE indicates its capability of support for Service Gap Control
in the Registration Request message to the AMF. The AMF passes the
Service Gap Time to the UE in the Registration Accept message for a UE
that has indicated its support of the Service Gap Control. The Service
Gap Control shall be applied in a UE when a Service Gap Time is stored
in the UE context and applied in the AMF when the Service Gap Time is
stored in the UE Context in the AMF.

Service Gap Control requires the UE to stay in CM-IDLE mode for at least
the whole duration of the Service Gap timer before triggering Mobile
Originated user data transmission, except for procedures that are
exempted (see TS 24.501 \[47\]). The Service Gap timer shall be started
each time a UE moves from CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE, unless the connection
request was initiated by the paging of a Mobile Terminated event, or
after a Mobility or Periodic Registration procedure without Follow-on
Request indication and without Uplink data status, which shall not
trigger a new or extended Service Gap interval. When a Service Gap timer
expires, the UE is allowed to send a connection request again. If the UE
does so, the Service Gap timer will be restarted at the next
CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE transition.

The Service Gap control is applied in CM-IDLE state only and does not
impact UE Mobile Originated user data transmission or Mobile Originated
signalling in CM-CONNECTED state. The Service Gap timer is not stopped
upon CM-IDLE state to CM-CONNECTED state transition. The UE shall not
initiate connection requests for MO user plane data, MO control plane
data, or MO SMS when a Service Gap timer is running. The UE shall not
initiate PDU Session Establishment Requests when a Service Gap timer is
running, unless it is for Emergency services which are allowed.
CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE is not used for UEs that have a Service
Gap Time configured.

NOTE 2: As a consequence of allowing Initial Registration Request
procedure, the UE with a running Service Gap timer does not initiate
further MO signalling, except for Mobility Registration procedure, until
the UE receives MT signalling or after the UE has moved to CM-IDLE state
and the Service Gap Timer is not running.

NOTE 3: Implementations need to make sure that latest and up-to-date
data are always sent when a Service Gap timer expires.

The AMF may enforce the Service Gap timer by rejecting connection
requests for MO user plane data, MO control plane data, or MO SMS when a
Service Gap timer is running. The AMF may enforce the Service Gap timer
by not allowing MO signalling after Initial Registration requests when a
Service Gap timer is running except for Mobility Registration procedure,
Periodic Registration procedure or access to the network for regulatory
prioritized services like Emergency services, which are allowed. When
rejecting the connection requests and the SM signalling after Initial
Registration Requests while the Service Gap timer is running, the AMF
may include a Mobility Management back-off timer corresponding to the
time left of the current Service Gap timer. For UEs that do not support
Service Gap Control (e.g. pre-release-16 UEs), Service Gap Control may
be enforced using \"General NAS level congestion control\" as defined in
clause 5.19.7.2.

NOTE 4: After MT signalling in CM-CONNECTED state the AMF does not
further restrict MO signalling when a Service Gap timer is running as
this case is considered equal to a connectivity request in response to
paging.

When the AMF starts the Service Gap timer, the AMF should invoke the
Service Gap timer with a value that is slightly shorter than the Service
Gap Time value provided to the UE based on the subscription information
received from the UDM.

NOTE 5: This ensures that the AMF does not reject any UE requests just
before the Service Gap timer expires e.g. because of slightly
unsynchronized timers between UE and AMF.

A UE which transitions from a MICO mode or eDRX power saving state shall
apply Service Gap Control when it wakes up if the Service Gap timer is
still running.

Additional aspects of Service Gap Control:

\- Service Gap Control applies in all PLMNs.

\- When the Service Gap timer is running and the UE receives paging, the
UE shall respond as normal.

\- Service Gap Control does not apply to exception reporting for NB-IoT.

\- Access to the network for regulatory prioritized services like
Emergency services are allowed when a Service Gap timer is running.

\- Service Gap Control shall be effective also for UEs performing
de-registration and re-registration unless access to the network for
regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services is required.

\- If the Service Gap timer is running, the Service Gap is applied at
PLMN selection as follows:

a\) Re-registration to the registered PLMN: The remaining Service Gap
timer value survives.

b\) Registration to a different PLMN: The remaining Service Gap timer
value survives.

c\) USIM swap: The Service Gap timer is no longer running and the
Service Gap feature does not apply, unless re-instantiated by the
serving PLMN.

\- Multiple uplink packets and downlink packets are allowed during one
RRC connection for UE operating within its Rate Control limits.

The following procedures are impacted by Service Gap Control:

\- Registration Procedure, see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\];

\- UE Triggered Service Request, see clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\];

NOTE 6: Since UE triggered Service Request is prevented by Service Gap
timer, this implicitly prevents the UE from initiating UPF anchored
Mobile Originated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
(see clause 4.24.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]), NEF Anchored Mobile Originated
Data Transport (see clause 4.25.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]) and MO SMS over
NAS in CM-IDLE (see clause 4.13.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

### 5.31.17 Inter-UE QoS for NB-IoT

To allow NG-RAN to prioritise resource allocation between different UEs
accessing via NB-IoT when some of the UEs are using Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation, NG-RAN may, based on configuration, retrieve from the
AMF the subscribed NB-IoT UE Priority for any UE accessing via NB-IoT by
using the UE\'s 5G-S-TMSI as the identifier.

In order to reduce signalling load on the AMF, NG-RAN may be configured
to request the NB-IoT UE Priority from the AMF e.g. only when the
NG-RAN\'s NB-IoT load exceeds certain threshold(s) or when the NG-RAN
needs to cache the QoS profile.

### 5.31.18 User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation

User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation enables transfer of user plane data
from CM-IDLE without the need for using the Service Request procedure to
establish Access Stratum (AS) context in NG-RAN and UE.

If the following preconditions are met:

\- UE and AMF negotiated support User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (see
clause 5.31.2) over NAS,

\- the UE has indicated support of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in
the UE radio capabilities as defined in TS 36.331 \[51\],

\- AMF has indicated User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation support for the UE
to NG-RAN,

\- the UE has established at least one PDU session with active UP
connection, i.e. AS context is established in NG-RAN and the UE,

then the RRC connection can be suspended by means of the Connection
Suspend Procedure (see clause 4.8.1.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

Based on a trigger from the NAS layer when a UE is in CM-IDLE with
Suspend, the UE should attempt the Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with
Suspend procedure (clause 4.8.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]). If the Connection
Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedure fails, the UE initiates the
pending NAS procedure. To maintain support for User Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation for UE mobility across different NG-RAN nodes, the AS
Context should be transferred between the NG-RAN nodes, see
TS 38.300 \[27\] and TS 38.423 \[99\].

By using the Connection Suspend Procedure:

\- the UE at transition into CM-IDLE stores the AS information;

\- NG-RAN stores the AS information, the NGAP UE association and the PDU
session context for that UE;

\- AMF stores the NGAP UE association and other information necessary to
later resume the UE, interacts with the SMF(s) to deactivate the user
plane resources for the UE\'s PDU Sessions and enters CM-IDLE.

NG-RAN may decide based on implementation to delete the stored UE
context and NGAP association. In that case, the RAN shall initiate the
AN Release procedure as described in clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 \[3\].
NG-RAN does not initiate any RRC procedure to notify the UE of the UE
context release.

By using the Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedure:

\- the UE resumes the connection from CM-IDLE with the network using the
AS information stored during the Connection Suspend procedure;

\- NG-RAN notifies the AMF that the connection with the UE has been
resumed;

\- AMF enters CM-CONNECTED and interacts with the SMF to activate the
user plane resources for the UE\'s PDU Sessions.

Early Data Transmission may be initiated by the UE for mobile originated
User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation during Connection Resume.

If the AMF establishes an NGAP UE association with a new NG-RAN node
different from the stored NGAP UE association, e.g. the UE initiates
service request or registration procedure from a different NG-RAN node,
the AMF initiates UE N2 release command towards the old NG-RAN node.

NG-RAN maintains the N3 tunnel endpoint information while a UE is in
CM-IDLE with Suspend. UPF is instructed to remove DL N3 Tunnel Info of
AN during Connection Suspend procedure, while UPF keeps UL N3 Tunnel
Info (i.e. UPF accepts and forwards UL data). If a UE sends MO data with
resume procedure, the NG-RAN can send the MO data to the UPF which is
addressed by the N3 tunnel endpoint information. In the case of change
of serving NG-RAN node due to UE mobility, if NG-RAN determines that it
is not able to connect to the UPF which is addressed by the N3 tunnel
endpoint information, NG-RAN performs Path Switch procedure before
sending the MO data received from the UE.

Early Data Transmission may be initiated by the UE for mobile originated
User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation when the RAT Type is E-UTRA.

### 5.31.19 QoS model for NB-IoT

5GC QoS model described in clause 5.7 applies to NB-IoT with the
following requirements:

\- The default QoS rule shall be the only QoS rule of a PDU Session for
a UE connected to 5GC via NB-IoT. There is only one QoS Flow
(corresponding to the default QoS rule) per PDU session.

\- Reflective QoS is not supported over NB-IoT.

\- For NB-IoT, there is a 1:1 mapping between the QoS Flow corresponding
to the default QoS of a PDU session and a Data Radio Bearer when user
plane resources are active for that PDU session.

\- A maximum of two Data Radio Bearers are supported over NB-IoT.
Therefore, at most two PDU sessions can have active user plane resources
at the same time.

\- The capability of multiple UP resource support for NB-IoT UEs is
indicated in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability (see TS 24.501 \[47\]).
During PDU Session Establishment or UP resource activation, the AMF
checks if the UE can support the establishment of user plane resources
(See clause 4.2.3.2 and clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

### 5.31.20 Category M UEs differentiation

This functionality is used by the network to identify traffic to/from
Category M UEs, e.g. for charging differentiation.

A Category M UE using E-UTRA shall provide a Category M indication to
the NG-RAN during RRC Connection Establishment procedure as defined in
TS 36.331 \[51\].

When the UE has provided a Category M indication to the NG-RAN during
RRC Connection Establishment, the NG-RAN shall provide an LTE-M
Indication to the AMF in the Initial UE Message (see clause 4.2.2.2.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] and TS 38.413 \[34\]).

When the AMF receives an LTE-M Indication from NG-RAN in an Initial UE
Message or from an MME during EPS to 5GS handover, the AMF shall store
the LTE-M Indication in the UE context, consider that the RAT type is
LTE-M and signal it accordingly to the SMSF during registration
procedure for SMS over NAS, to the SMF during PDU Session Establishment
or PDU Session Modification procedure. The PCF will also receive the RAT
Type as LTE-M, when applicable, from the SMF during SM Policy
Association Establishment or SM Policy Association Modification
procedure.

The NFs generating CDRs shall include the LTE-M RAT type in their CDRs.

Upon AMF change or inter-system mobility from 5GS to EPS, the source AMF
shall provide the \"LTE-M Indication\" to the target AMF or MME as part
of the UE context.

During EPS to 5GS Mobility Registration Procedure, the AMF shall
disregard any \"LTE-M Indication\" received from the MME in the UE
context (see TS 23.401 \[26\]), and take into account the \"LTE-M
Indication\" received from NG-RAN, as specified above.

## 5.32 Support for ATSSS

### 5.32.1 General

The ATSSS feature is an optional feature that may be supported by the UE
and the 5GC network.

The ATSSS feature enables a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, which
can exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously
using one 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network and two
independent N3/N9 tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN. The multi-access
PDU Connectivity Service is realized by establishing a Multi-Access PDU
(MA PDU) Session, i.e. a PDU Session that may have user-plane resources
on two access networks. This assumes both 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access are allowed for the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session.

The UE may request a MA PDU Session when the UE is registered via both
3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, or when the UE is registered via one access
only.

After the establishment of a MA PDU Session, and when there are
user-plane resources on both access networks, the UE applies
network-provided policy (i.e. ATSSS rules) and considers local
conditions (such as network interface availability, signal loss
conditions, user preferences, etc.) for deciding how to distribute the
uplink traffic across the two access networks. Similarly, the UPF anchor
of the MA PDU Session applies network-provided policy (i.e. N4 rules)
and feedback information received from the UE via the user-plane (such
as access network Unavailability or Availability) for deciding how to
distribute the downlink traffic across the two N3/N9 tunnels and two
access networks. When there are user-plane resources on only one access
network, the UE applies the ATSSS rules and considers local conditions
for triggering the establishment or activation of the user plane
resources over another access.

The type of a MA PDU Session may be one of the following types defined
in clause 5.6.1: IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, and Ethernet. In this release of
the specification, the Unstructured type is not supported. The
clause 5.32.6.2.1 and the clause 5.32.6.3.1 below define what Steering
Functionalities can be used for each supported type of a MA PDU Session.

The handling of 3GPP PS Data Off feature for MA PDU Session is specified
in clause 5.24.

The ATSSS feature can be supported over any type of access network,
including untrusted and trusted non-3GPP access networks (see clauses
4.2.8 and 5.5), wireline 5G access networks (see clause 4.2.8), etc., as
long as a MA PDU Session can be established over this type of access
network.

In this Release of the specification, a MA PDU Session using IPv6
multi-homing (see clause 5.6.4.3) or UL Classifier (see clause 5.6.4.2)
is not specified.

In this Release of the specification, support for ATSSS assumes SMF
Service Areas covering the whole PLMN or that a MA PDU Session is
released over both accesses when the UE moves out of the SMF Service
Area.

A MA PDU Session does not support LADN. If the AMF receives a request to
establish a MA PDU Session for a LADN DNN, the AMF shall reject the
request. If the AMF receives a request to establish a PDU Session for a
LADN DNN with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication, the AMF
shall not forward \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication to the
SMF.

If the UE, due to mobility, moves from being served by a source AMF
supporting ATSSS to a target AMF not supporting ATSSS, the MA PDU
Session is released as described in TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 1: Deployment of ATSSS that is homogeneous per PLMN or network
slice enables consistent behaviour. In the case of non-homogenous
support of ATSSS in a PLMN/slice (i.e. some NFs in a PLMN/slice may not
support ATSSS), MA PDU Sessions can be released due to UE mobility.

A Multi-Access PDU Session may for the 3GPP access use user-plane
resources of an associated PDN Connection on 3GPP access in EPC instead
of the 3GPP access to 5GC. This enables a scenario where a MA PDU
Session can simultaneously be associated with user-plane resources on
3GPP access network connected to EPC and non-3GPP access connected to
5GC. Such use of ATSSS with EPS interworking may apply to Ethernet and
IP-based PDU Session and PDN Connection types.

NOTE 2: A MA PDU Session with one 3GPP access connected to 5GC and one
non-3GPP access connected to EPC is not supported.

NOTE 3: Co-existence with NBIFOM is not defined. It is assumed that
NBIFOM and the multi-access connectivity described in this clause are
not deployed in the same network.

NOTE 4: To the MME and SGW this is a regular PDN Connection and the
support for ATSSS is transparent to MME and SGW.

For a MA PDU Session established for the Ethernet PDU Session type, if
the UE has not indicated support for Ethernet PDN connection type or if
the network does not support Ethernet PDN connection type, when the 3GPP
access use user-plane resources of an associated PDN Connection, the
following takes place:

\- The SMF+PGW-C considers that the Multi-Access PDU Session is still
using the Ethernet PDU Session / PDN Connection type but in a restricted
mode where EPS signalling can only refer to non-IP PDN Connection type.

\- MAR rules in the UPF are still used for distributing DL traffic
between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

\- For traffic on 3GPP access, the SMF may update N4 rules and QoS
rules/EPS bearer contexts on the UE to take into account that no QoS
differentiation is possible over 3GPP access.

This support of Multi-Access PDU Sessions using for the 3GPP access
user-plane resources of an associated PDN Connection instead of the 3GPP
access to 5GC is further defined in TS 23.502 \[3\].

The following clauses specify the functionality that enables ATSSS.

### 5.32.2 Multi Access PDU Sessions

A Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session is managed by using the session
management functionality specified in clause 5.6, with the following
additions and modifications:

\- When the UE wants to request a new MA PDU Session:

\- If the UE is registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request
over any of the two accesses. The UE also provides Request Type as \"MA
PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport message. The AMF informs the SMF
that the UE is registered over both accesses and this triggers the
establishment of user-plane resources on both accesses and two N3/N9
tunnels between PSA and the RAN/AN.

\- If the UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request
over one access. The UE also provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\"
in the UL NAS Transport message. After this PDU Session is established
with one N3/N9 tunnel between the PSA and (R)AN established, the UE
shall send another PDU Session Establishment Request over the other
access. The UE also provides the same PDU Session ID and Request Type as
\"MA PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport message. Two N3/N9 tunnels
and User-plane resources on both accesses are established.

\- If the UE is registered over one access only, then the UE shall send
a PDU Session Establishment Request over this access. The UE also
provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport
message. One N3/N9 tunnel between the PSA and (R)AN and User-plane
resources on this access only are established. After the UE is
registered over the second access, the UE shall establish user-plane
resources on the second access.

\- In the PDU Session Establishment Request that is sent to request a
new MA PDU Session, the UE shall provide also its ATSSS capabilities,
which indicate the steering functionalities and the steering modes
supported in the UE. These functionalities are defined in clause 5.32.6.

\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1)
and the network accepts to activate this functionality, then the network
may provide to UE Measurement Assistance Information (see details in
clause 5.32.5) and shall provide to UE one or more ATSSS rules.

\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the MPTCP
functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL functionality with
only the Active-Standby steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1)
and the network accepts to activate these functionalities, then the
network provides MPTCP proxy information to UE, and allocates to UE one
IP address/prefix for the MA PDU session (as defined in clause 5.8.2.2)
and two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called \"link-specific
multipath\" addresses. Further details are provided in clause 5.32.6.2.
In addition, the network may provide to UE Measurement Assistance
Information and shall provide to UE one or more ATSSS rules including an
ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP traffic. The ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP traffic
shall use the ATSSS-LL functionality and the Active-Standby Steering
Mode to indicate how the non-MPTCP traffic shall be transferred across
the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access in the uplink direction.

\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the MPTCP
functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL functionality with
any steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1) and the network
accepts to activate these functionalities, then the network provides
MPTCP proxy information to UE, and allocates to UE one IP address/prefix
for the MA PDU session (as defined in clause 5.8.2.2) and two additional
IP addresses/prefixes, called \"link-specific multipath\" addresses.
Further details are provided in clause 5.32.6.2. In addition, the
network may provide to UE Measurement Assistance Information and shall
provide to UE one or more ATSSS rules.

\- If the UE requests an S-NSSAI, this S-NSSAI should be allowed on both
accesses. Otherwise, the MA PDU Session shall not be established.

\- The SMF determines the ATSSS capabilities supported for the MA PDU
Session based on the ATSSS capabilities provided by the UE and per DNN
configuration on SMF, as follows:

a\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only
Active-Standby steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), the
DNN configuration allows both MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode,
including RTT measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session
is capable of (1) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode in the
downlink, and (2) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the
uplink.

NOTE 1: In this case, it is assumed that ATSSS-LL with \"Smallest
Delay\" steering mode is selected for the downlink only when the UPF can
measure RTT without using the PMF protocol, e.g. by using other means
not defined by 3GPP such as using the RTT measurements of MPTCP.

b\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only
Active-Standby steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), the
DNN configuration allows both MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode,
but not RTT measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session
is capable of (1) MPTCP with any steering mode in the downlink (2)
ATSSS-LL with any steering mode except Smallest Delay steering mode in
the downlink, and (3) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the
uplink.

c\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only
Active-Standby steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1) and if
the DNN configuration allows MPTCP with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
with only Active-Standby steering mode, the MA PDU Session is capable of
MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink and in the
downlink.

d\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1)
and the DNN configuration allows ATSSS-LL with any steering mode, the MA
PDU Session is capable of ATSSS-LL with any steering mode in the uplink
and in the downlink.

e\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering
mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), and the DNN configuration
allows both MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode, the MA PDU
Session is capable of both MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode in
the uplink and in the downlink.

The SMF provides the ATSSS capabilities of the MA PDU Session to the PCF
during PDU Session Establishment.

\- The PCC rules provided by PCF include MA PDU Session Control
information (see TS 23.503 \[45\]). They are used by SMF to derive ATSSS
rules for the UE and N4 rules for the UPF. When dynamic PCC is not used
for the MA PDU Session, the SMF shall provide ATSSS rules and N4 rules
based on local configuration (e.g. based on DNN or S-NSSAI).

\- The UE receives ATSSS rules from SMF, which indicate how the uplink
traffic should be routed across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
Similarly, the UPF receives N4 rules from SMF, which indicate how the
downlink traffic should be routed across 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access.

\- When the SMF receives a PDU Session Establishment Request and a \"MA
PDU Request\" indication and determines that UP security protection (see
clause 5.10.3) is required for the PDU Session, the SMF shall only
confirm the establishment of the MA PDU session if the 3GPP access
network can enforce the required UP security protection. The SMF needs
not confirm whether the non-3GPP access can enforce the required UP
security protection.

\- After the MA PDU Session establishment:

\- At any given time, the MA PDU session may have user-plane resources
on both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, or on one access only, or may have
no user-plane resources on any access.

\- The AMF, SMF, PCF and UPF maintain their MA PDU Session contexts,
even when the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on
the other access).

\- When the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on
the other access), the AMF informs the SMF to release the resource of
this access type in the UPF for the MA PDU Session. Subsequently, the
SMF notifies the UPF that the access type has become unavailable and the
N3/N9 tunnel for the access type are released.

\- If the UE wants to add user-plane resources on one access of the MA
PDU Session, e.g. based on access network performance measurement and/or
ATSSS rules, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request
over this access containing PDU Session ID of the MA PDU Session. The UE
also provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" and the same PDU
Session ID in the UL NAS Transport message. If there is no N3/N9 tunnel
for this access, the N3/N9 tunnel for this access is established.

\- If the UE wants to re-activate user-plane resources on one access of
the MA PDU Session, e.g. based on access network performance measurement
and/or ATSSS rules, then the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service
Request procedure over this access.

\- If the network wants to re-activate the user-plane resources over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access of the MA PDU Session, the network shall
initiate the Network Triggered Service Request procedure, as specified
in clause 4.22.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- The SMF may add, remove or update one or more individual ATSSS rules
of the UE by sending new or updated ATSSS rules with the corresponding
Rule IDs to the UE.

A MA PDU Session may be established either:

a\) when it is explicitly requested by an ATSSS-capable UE; or

b\) when an ATSSS-capable UE requests a single-access PDU Session but
the network decides to establish a MA PDU Session instead. This is an
optional scenario specified in clause 4.22.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], which
may occur when the UE requests a single-access PDU Session but no policy
(e.g. no URSP rule) and no local restrictions in the UE mandate a single
access for the PDU Session.

A MA PDU Session may be established during a PDU Session modification
procedure when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, as specified in
clause 4.22.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AMF indicates as part of the Registration procedure whether ATSSS is
supported or not. When ATSSS is not supported, the UE shall not

\- request establishment of a MA PDU Session (as described in
clause 4.22.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]); or

\- request addition of User Plane resources for an existing MA PDU
Session (as described in clause 4.22.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\]); or

\- request establishment of a PDU Session with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade
Allowed\" indication (as described in clause 4.22.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]);
or

\- request PDU Session Modification with Request Type of \"MA PDU
request\" or with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication after
moving from EPC to 5GC (as described in clause 4.22.6.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]).

An ATSSS-capable UE may decide to request a MA PDU Session based on the
provisioned URSP rules. In particular, the UE should request a MA PDU
Session when the UE applies a URSP rule, which triggers the UE to
establish a new PDU Session and the Access Type Preference component of
the URSP rule indicates \"Multi-Access\" (see TS 23.503 \[45\]).

### 5.32.3 Policy for ATSSS Control

If dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the PCF may take
ATSSS policy decisions and create PCC rules that contain MA PDU Session
Control information, (as specified in TS 23.503 \[45\]), which
determines how the uplink and the downlink traffic of the MA PDU Session
should be distributed across the 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. If dynamic
PCC is not deployed, local policy in SMF is used.

The SMF receives the PCC rules with MA PDU Session Control information
and maps these rules into (a) ATSSS rules, which are sent to the UE, and
(b) N4 rules, which are sent to the UPF. The ATSSS rules are provided as
a prioritized list of rules (see clause 5.32.8), which are applied by
the UE to enforce the ATSSS policy in the uplink direction and the N4
Rules are applied by the UPF to enforce the ATSSS policy in the downlink
direction.

The ATSSS rules are sent to UE with a NAS message when the MA PDU
Session is created or updated by the SMF, e.g. after receiving
updated/new PCC rules from the PCF. Similarly, the N4 rules are sent to
UPF when the MA PDU Session is created or updated by the SMF.

The details of the policy control related to ATSSS are specified in
TS 23.503 \[45\].

### 5.32.4 QoS Support

The 5G QoS model for the Single-Access PDU Session is also applied to
the MA PDU Session, i.e. the QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS
differentiation in the MA PDU Session. One difference compared to the
Single-Access PDU Session is that in a MA PDU Session there can be
separate user-plane tunnels between the AN and the PSA, each one
associated with a different access. However, the QoS Flow is not
associated with specific access, i.e. it is access agnostic, so the same
QoS is supported when the traffic is distributed over 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses. The SMF shall provide the same QFI in 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses so that the same QoS is supported in both accesses.

A QoS Flow of the MA PDU Session may be either Non-GBR or GBR depending
on its QoS profile.

For a Non-GBR QoS Flow, the SMF provides a QoS profile 5G-AN(s) during
MA PDU Session Establishment or MA PDU Session Modification procedure:

\- During MA PDU Session Establishment procedure, the QoS profile to
both ANs if the UE is registered over both accesses.

\- During MA PDU Session Modification procedure, the QoS profile is
provided to the 5G-AN(s) over which the user plane resources are
activated.

For a GBR QoS Flow, the SMF shall provide a QoS profile to a single
access network as follows:

\- If the PCC rule allows a GBR QoS Flow in a single access, the SMF
provides the QoS profile for the GBR QoS Flow to the access network
allowed by the PCC rule.

\- If the PCC rule allows a GBR QoS Flow in both accesses, the SMF
decides to which access network to provide the QoS profile for the GBR
QoS Flow based on its local policy (e.g. the access where the traffic is
ongoing according to the Multi Access Routing rules).

For a GBR QoS Flow, traffic splitting is not supported because the QoS
profile is provided to a single access network at a given time. If the
UPF determines that it cannot send GBR traffic over the current ongoing
access e.g. based on the N4 rules and access availability and
unavailability report from the UE as described in clause 5.32.5.3, the
UPF shall send an Access Availability report to the SMF. Based on the
report, the SMF decides whether to move GBR QoS Flows to the other
access:

\- if the PCC rule allows the GBR QoS Flows only on this access, the SMF
shall release the resources for the GBR QoS Flow and report to the PCF
about the removal of the PCC rule.

\- if the corresponding PCC rule allows the GBR QoS Flow on both
accesses and the other access is not available, the SMF shall release
the resources for the GBR QoS Flow and report to the PCF about the
removal of the PCC rule.

\- if the PCC rule allows the GBR QoS Flow on both accesses and the
other access is available, the SMF shall try to move the GBR QoS Flow to
the other access. The SMF may trigger a PDU session modification
procedure to provide the QoS profile to the other access and release the
resources for the GBR QoS Flow in the current access.

\- If Notification Control parameter is not included in the PCC rule for
the GBR QoS Flow and the other access does not accept the QoS profile,
the SMF shall release the resources for the GBR QoS Flow and report to
the PCF about the removal of the PCC rule.

\- if the Notification Control parameter is included in the PCC rule,
the SMF shall notify the PCF that GFBR can no longer be guaranteed.
After the other access accepts the QoS profile, the SMF shall notify the
PCF that GFBR can again be guaranteed. If the other access does not
accept the QoS profile, the SMF shall delete the GBR QoS Flow and report
to the PCF about the removal of the PCC rule.

NOTE 1: The ATSSS rule for GBR QoS Flow only allows the UE to steer
traffic over a single access so that network knows in which access the
UE sends GBR traffic. If the network wants to move GBR QoS Flow to the
other access, the network needs to update ATSSS rule of the UE.

When the MA PDU Session is established or when the MA PDU Session is
modified, the SMF may provide QoS rule(s) to the UE via one access,
which are applied by the UE as specified in clause 5.7.1.4. The QoS
rule(s) provided by SMF via one access are commonly used for both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access, so the QoS classification is independent of
ATSSS rules.

The derived QoS rule generated by Reflective QoS is applied
independently of the access on which the RQI was received. When the
MPTCP functionality is used in the UE, the UE shall use the IP
address/prefix of the MA PDU Session and the final destination address
to generate the derived QoS rule.

When MPTCP functionality is enabled for the MA PDU Session:

\- any QoS rules or PDRs that apply to the MA PDU Session IP
address/prefix and port also apply to the \"link-specific multipath\"
addresses/prefixes and ports used by the UE to establish MPTCP subflows
over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses; and

\- any QoS rules or PDRs that apply to the IP address/prefix and port of
the final destination server in DN also apply to the IP address and port
of the MPTCP proxy for corresponding MPTCP subflows that are terminated
at the proxy.

NOTE 2: How these associations are made is left up to the UE and UPF
implementations.

### 5.32.5 Access Network Performance Measurements

#### 5.32.5.1 General principles

When an MA PDU Session is established, the network may provide the UE
with Measurement Assistance Information. This information assists the UE
in determining which measurements shall be performed over both accesses,
as well as whether measurement reports need to be sent to the network.

Measurement Assistance Information shall include the addressing
information of a Performance Measurement Function (PMF) in the UPF, the
UE can send PMF protocol messages to:

\- For a PDU Session of IP type, Measurement Assistance Information
contains one IP address for the PMF, one UDP port associated with 3GPP
access and another UDP port associated with non-3GPP access. PMF
messages sent by UE to one of these UDP ports, shall be transmitted to
UPF via the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.

\- For a PDU Session of Ethernet type, Measurement Assistance
Information contains one MAC address associated with 3GPP access and
another MAC address associated with non-3GPP access. PMF messages sent
by UE to one of these MAC addresses, shall be transmitted to UPF via the
QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.

NOTE 1: To protect the PMF in the UPF (e.g. to block DDOS to the PMF),
the IP addresses of the PMF are only accessible from the UE IP address
via the N3/N9 interface.

NOTE 2: After the MA PDU Session is released, the same UE IP
address/prefix is not allocated to another UE for MA PDU Session in a
short time.

If the SMF determines that access performance measurements per QoS Flow
shall be applied for the MA PDU Session, then the Measurement Assistance
Information shall also include a list of QoS Flows on which access
performance measurements may be performed. For each QoS Flow in this
list, the following information is included:

\- The QFI of the associated QoS Flow.

\- For a PDU Session of IP type, one UDP port associated with 3GPP
access and another UDP port associated with non-3GPP access. PMF
messages sent by UE to one of these UDP ports, shall be transmitted to
UPF via the associated QoS Flow.

\- For a PDU Session of Ethernet type, one MAC address associated with
3GPP access and another MAC address associated with non-3GPP access. PMF
messages sent by UE to one of these MAC addresses, shall be transmitted
to UPF via the associated QoS Flow.

The QoS rules and the N4 rules provided by SMF to UE and to UPF
respectively shall include information (e.g. packet filters containing
the UDP port or the MAC address associated with a QoS Flow), which
enables the UE and UPF to route a PMF message to a specific QoS Flow.

The UE and the UPF may need to perform access performance measurements
in order to estimate the Round-Trip Time (RTT) and/or the Packet Loss
Rate (PLR) that an SDF is expected to experience when transmitted on a
certain access type. Based on these measurements and the provisioned
ATSSS rules in the UE and MAR rules in the UPF, the UE and the UPF
decide how to distribute the traffic of an SDF across the two accesses.

If the UE and the UPF decide to initiate access performance measurements
to estimate the RTT and/or the PLR for an SDF, the access performance
measurements shall be performed either

\(a\) using the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule; or

\(b\) using the target QoS Flow, which is the QoS Flow that the SDF
traffic is transmitted on.

When the access performance measurements are using the target QoS Flow,
it is termed that \"access performance measurements per QoS Flow\" are
applied for the MA PDU Session.

The UE shall indicate in its ATSSS capabilities that it supports access
performance measurements per QoS Flow. Based on this UE capability and
other information (such as local policy), the SMF determines whether
access performance measurements per QoS Flow shall be applied for the MA
PDU Session or not. If the SMF determines that access performance
measurements per QoS Flow shall be applied for the MA PDU Session, then:

\- The SMF determines a list of QoS Flows over which access performance
measurements may be performed and provides this list to the UE (within
the Measurement Assistance Information) and to the UPF.

\- The UE and the UPF may initiate access performance measurements on
one or more of the QoS Flows included in this list. The UE and the UPF
shall be able to receive and respond to PMF messages sent on any QoS
Flow included in this list.

\- The SMF may update the list of QoS Flows over which access
performance measurements may be performed during the lifetime of a MA
PDU Session, e.g. when a new PCC rule that could benefit from PMF access
performance measurements is bound to a QoS Flow.

NOTE 3: The SMF can e.g. add a QoS Flow into the list when at least one
PCC Rule is bound to that QoS Flow that is using one of the Steering
Modes where performance measurements via PMF are applicable, such as
Lowest Delay Steering Mode or a Steering Mode where threshold values
have been provided.

The UE shall perform access performance measurements per QoS Flow only
when this is explicitly indicated in the Measurement Assistance
Information, i.e. only when the UE receives the list of QoS Flows over
which access performance measurements may be performed. Otherwise, the
UE shall perform access performance measurements based on the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule. The UPF shall perform access
performance measurements per QoS Flow only when this is explicitly
indicated by SMF, i.e. only when the UPF receives the list of QoS Flows
over which access performance measurements may be performed. Otherwise,
the UPF shall perform access performance measurements based on the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule. In this case the UPF learns
what QoS Flow to use as described in TS 29.244 \[65\].

The UE and the UPF may decide not to initiate access performance
measurements using PMF over a certain target QoS Flow, when they already
have access performance measurements for another target QoS Flow which
they determine can be reused.

NOTE 4: How the UE and UPF determine that the performance measurements
using a certain target QoS Flow apply to another target QoS Flow is
based on implementation, e.g. AN resource to QoS Flow mapping in the UE
or getting similar access measurements results with other QoS Flow.

When access performance measurements for an SDF are performed based on
the target QoS Flow, the UE needs to be able to determine the QoS Flow a
downlink packet arrives on. In order to enable this, the SMF shall
include downlink Packet Filter information in the QoS rule provided to
UE matching this SDF, unless Reflective QoS is used for the SDF.

NOTE 5: For example, if a QoS Flow requires to activate Reflective QoS,
the SMF does not need to provide downlink QoS Flow information for the
QoS Flow to minimize usage of packet filters. When a data packet is
received over a QoS Flow, the UE can decide whether to check the
downlink QoS Flow information based on the existence of SDAP header for
the QoS Flow.

The addressing information of the PMF in the UPF is retrieved by the SMF
from the UPF during N4 session establishment. If the UPF receives from
the SMF, during N4 session establishment or modification procedure, a
list of QoS Flows over which access performance measurements may be
performed, the UPF allocates different UDP ports per QoS Flow per access
for IP PDU sessions, or allocates different MAC addresses per QoS Flow
per access for Ethernet PDU sessions. For IP PDU sessions, the UPF sends
the PMF IP addressing information and the UDP ports with the QFI of the
associated QoS Flow to the SMF. For Ethernet PDU sessions, the UPF sends
the MAC addresses with the QFI of the associated QoS Flow to the SMF.

The following PMF protocol messages can be exchanged between the UE and
the PMF:

\- Messages to allow for Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements, i.e. when
the \"Smallest Delay\" steering mode is used or when either
\"Priority-based\" or \"Load-Balancing\" steering mode is used with RTT
threshold value being applied;

\- Messages to allow for Packet Loss Rate (PLR) measurements, i.e. when
steering mode is used either \"Priority-based\" or \"Load-Balancing\"
steering mode is used with PLR threshold value being applied;

\- Messages for reporting Access availability/unavailability by the UE
to the UPF.

\- Messages for sending UE-assistance data to UPF. Such messages may be
sent from the UE to UPF only when the UE receives the UE-assistance
indicator in an ATSSS rule, as specified in clause 5.32.8. Further
details are provided in clause 5.32.5.5.

Since steering modes can be different in up-link and down-link, the UE
needs to be able to handle PMF protocol messages for RTT and PLR
measurements received from UPF even if it is not using one of the
steering modes associated with the RTT and PLR measurements (and vice
versa).

The PMF protocol is specified in TS 24.193 \[109\].

The PMF protocol messages used for access availability/unavailability
reports shall be sent on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule. The PMF protocol messages used for access performance measurements
shall be sent either on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule, or on the target QoS Flow, as specified above.

The QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule for MA PDU Session is
Non-GBR QoS Flow.

The UE shall not apply the ATSSS rules and the UPF shall not apply the
MAR rules for the PMF protocol messages.

When the UE requests a MA PDU session and indicates it is capable to
support the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL
functionality with only the Active-Standby steering mode (as specified
in clause 5.32.6.1), the network may send Measurement Assistance
Information for the UE to send Access availability/unavailability
reports to the UPF. In this case, the UE and UPF shall not perform RTT
and PLR measurements using PMF as the UE and UPF can use measurements
available at the MPTCP layer.

#### 5.32.5.1a Address of PMF messages

As described in clause 5.32.5.2, 5.32.5.2a and 5.32.5.3, a UE and UPF
may exchange PMF messages to measure access performance and report
access availability/unavailability. When the UE and UPF exchanges PMF
message, source and destination address of the PMF messages shall be
assigned as follows:

1\. In the case of a MA PDU Session of IP type:

\- If access performance measurements are performed only over the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule, the PMF in the UE sends PMF
messages to the PMF in the UPF over UDP/IP. The destination IP address
is the IP address contained in the Measurement Assistance Information
and the destination UDP port is one of the two UDP ports contained in
the Measurement Assistance Information. One UDP port is used for sending
PMF messages to UPF over 3GPP access and the other UDP port is used for
sending PMF messages to UPF over non-3GPP access. The source IP address
is the IP address assigned to UE for the MA PDU Session and the source
UDP port is a UDP port that is dynamically allocated by the UE for PMF
communication. This source UDP port in the UE remains the same for the
entire lifetime of the MA PDU Session.

If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed, the
Measurement Assistance Information contains UDP ports, one for each QoS
Flow and access combination. When the UE sends PMF message over a QoS
Flow of an access, the UE shall set the destination UDP port as the UDP
port for the QoS Flow and the access in Measurement Assistance
information.

\- If access performance measurements are performed only over the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule, the PMF in the UPF sends PMF
messages to the PMF in the UE over UDP/IP. The source IP address is the
same IP address as the one provided in the Measurement Assistance
Information and the source UDP port is one of the two UDP ports as
provided in the Measurement Assistance Information. One UDP port is used
for sending PMF messages to UE over 3GPP access and the other UDP port
is used for sending PMF messages to UE over the non-3GPP access. The
destination IPv4 address is the IPv4 address assigned to UE for the MA
PDU Session (if any) and the destination IPv6 address is an IPv6 address
selected by the UE from the IPv6 prefix assigned for the MA PDU Session
(if any). The destination UDP port is the dynamically allocated UDP port
in the UE, which is contained in all PMF messages received from the UE.

If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed, when the
UPF sends PMF message over a QoS Flow of an access, the UPF shall set
the source UDP port with the UDP port for the QoS Flow and the access as
the one for the QoS Flow and the access provided in Measurement
Assistance information.

\- If the UE receives Measurement Assistance Information, the UE shall
inform the network via the user plane about the UE\'s dynamically
allocated UDP port, and the IPv6 address if IPv6 is used for PMF
messages, so that it is possible for the UPF to know the UE\'s IPv6
address (if applicable) and dynamically allocated UDP port as soon as
the MA PDU Session has been established.

NOTE 1: Regardless of whether access performance measurements per QoS
Flow is applied or not, the UE only allocates a single UDP port for PMF
messages.

2\. In the case of a MA PDU Session of Ethernet type:

\- The PMF in the UE sends PMF messages to the PMF in the UPF over
Ethernet. The Ethertype is the Ethertype contained in the Measurement
Assistance Information. If access performance measurements are performed
only over the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, the
destination MAC address is one of the two MAC addresses contained in the
Measurement Assistance Information. One MAC address is used for sending
PMF messages to UPF over 3GPP access and the other MAC address is used
for sending PMF messages to UPF over non-3GPP access. The source MAC
address is a MAC address of the UE, which remains the same for the
entire lifetime of the MA PDU Session.

If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed,
Measurement Assistance Information contains MAC addresses for each QoS
Flow and each access. When the UE sends PMF message over a QoS Flow of
an access, the UE shall set the destination MAC address as the MAC
address for the QoS Flow and the access in Measurement Assistance
information.

\- The PMF in the UPF sends PMF messages to the PMF in the UE over
Ethernet. The Ethertype is the same Ethertype as the one provided in the
Measurement Assistance Information. If access performance measurements
are performed only over the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule, the source MAC address is one of the two MAC addresses as provided
in the Measurement Assistance Information. One MAC address is used for
sending PMF messages to UE over 3GPP access and the other MAC address is
used for sending PMF messages to UE over non-3GPP access. The
destination MAC address is the MAC address of the UE, which is contained
in all PMF messages received from the UE.

If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed, when the
UPF sends PMF message over a QoS Flow of an access, the UPF shall set
the source MAC address with the MAC address for the QoS Flow and the
access as the one for the QoS Flow and the access provided in
Measurement Assistance information.

\- If the UE receives Measurement Assistance Information, the UE shall
inform the network via the user plane about the UE\'s MAC address so
that it is possible for the UPF to know the UE\'s MAC address as soon as
the MA PDU Session has been established.

NOTE 2: Regardless of whether access performance measurements per QoS
Flow is applied or not, the UE only use a single MAC address.

#### 5.32.5.2 Round Trip Time Measurements

RTT measurements can be conducted by the UE and UPF independently. There
is no measurement reporting from one side to the other. RTT measurements
are defined to support the \"Smallest Delay\", \"Priority-based\" or
\"Load Balancing\" steering mode (i.e. when RTT threshold value is
applied).

The estimation of the RTT by the UE and by the UPF is based on the
following mechanism:

1\. The PMF in the UE sends over the user plane PMF-Echo Request
messages to the PMF in the UPF, and the PMF in the UPF responds to each
one with a PMF-Echo Response message. Similarly, the PMF in the UPF
sends over the user plane PMF-Echo Request messages to the PMF in the
UE, and the PMF in the UE responds to each one with a PMF-Echo Response
message.

2\. When the UP connection of the MA PDU session is deactivated on an
access, no PMF-Echo Request messages are sent on this access. The PMF in
the UPF shall not send PMF-Echo Request on this access if the UP
connection is not available or after it receives notification from the
(H-)SMF to stop sending the PMF-Echo Request on this access.

3\. The UE and the UPF derive an estimation of the average RTT over an
access type and QoS Flow by averaging the RTT measurements obtained over
this access type and QoS Flow.

#### 5.32.5.2a Packet Loss Rate Measurements

The UE and the UPF may decide to estimate the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) for
an SDF over both accesses. For example, the UE may take this decision
when an ATSSS rule in the UE requires the traffic of an SDF to be
steered in accordance with a PLR-based threshold condition (e.g. PLR \<
2%).

The UE and the UPF calculate the PLR for an SDF by exchanging PMF-PLR
Report messages, as specified below. A PMF-PLR Report message is sent
over 3GPP access or over non-3GPP access, using either the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule or a \"target\" QoS Flow, as
specified in clause 5.32.5.1.

The calculation of the PLR by the UE and by the UPF is based on the
following mechanism. It is assumed that the PLR should be calculated for
a target QoS Flow, however, the same mechanism applies when the PLR
should be calculated for the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule.

\- The UE requests from UPF to start counting the number of received UL
packets by sending a PMF-PLR Count Request message over the target QoS
Flow. The UPF starts counting of the received UL packets over the target
QoS Flow and over the access network which the PMF-PLR Count Request
message was received from. The UE starts counting the transmitted UL
packets over the target QoS Flow and access network when it sends a
PMF-PLR Count Request message to UPF.

\- The UE stops the counting and requests from UPF to report the number
of counted UL packets by sending a PMF-PLR Report Request message over
the target QoS Flow. The UPF stops the counting and sends a PMF-PLR
Report Response message over the QoS Flow including the number of UL
packets counted since it received the last PMF-PLR Count Request
message.

NOTE 1: A PMF-PLR Report Request message can also indicate to UPF to
start counting packets if the UE wants to measure the Packet Loss Rate
again.

\- The UE calculates the UL packet loss ratio based on the local
counting result of the number of transmitted UL packets and reported
number of received UL packets in the UPF.

\- The UPF applies the same procedure for calculating the DL PLR, i.e.
it sends to UE a PMF-PLR Count Request message on a target QoS Flow to
request from UE to start counting the number of DL packets received on
this target QoS Flow. As defined in clause 5.32.5.1, the UE determines
which DL packets are received on the target QoS Flow by checking the QFI
included in the header of DL packets (e.g. in the SDAP header). If no
QFI is included in the header of a DL packet, the UE determines the QFI
for this DL packet by applying the Packet Filters for downlink in the
QoS Rules received from SMF.

\- When the UP connection of the MA PDU session is deactivated on an
access, no PMF-PLR messages are sent on this access. The PMF in the UPF
shall not send PMF-PLR message on this access if the UP connection is
not available or after it receives notification from the (H-)SMF to stop
sending the PMF-PLR message on this access.

\- The UE and the UPF derive an estimation of the average PLR per QoS
Flow over an access type by averaging the PLR measurements obtained over
this access.

NOTE 2: The details of the packet loss measurements, including error
cases and mechanisms for improving the measurement accuracy, are
considered in the Stage 3 specifications.

#### 5.32.5.3 Access Availability/Unavailability Report

If required by the network in the Measurement Assistance Information,
the UE shall provide access availability/unavailability reports to the
network. How the UE detects the unavailability and the availability of
an access is based on implementation. When the UE detects the
unavailability/availability of an access, it shall:

\- build a PMF-Access Report containing the access type and an
indication of availability/unavailability of this access;

\- send the PMF-Access Report to the UPF via the user plane.

The UPF shall acknowledge the PMF-Access Report received from the UE.

#### 5.32.5.4 Protocol stack for user plane measurements and measurement reports

![](media/image77.emf)

Figure 5.32.5.4-1: UE/UPF measurements related protocol stack for 3GPP
access and for an MA PDU Session with type IP

In the case of an MA PDU Session with type Ethernet, the protocol stack
over 3GPP access is that same as the one in the above figure, but the
PMF protocol operates on top of Ethernet, instead of UDP/IP.

![](media/image78.emf)

Untrusted non-3GPP access and for an MA PDU Session with type IP

In the case of an MA PDU Session with type Ethernet, the protocol stack
over Untrusted non-3GPP access is the same as the one in the above
figure, but the PMF protocol operates on top of Ethernet, instead of
UDP/IP.

![](media/image79.emf)

In the case of an MA PDU Session with type Ethernet, the protocol stack
over Trusted non-3GPP access is the same as the one in the above figure,
but the PMF protocol operates on top of Ethernet, instead of UDP/IP.

#### 5.32.5.5 UE Assistance Operation

When UE-assistance operation is authorized by the PCF in the PCC Rule,
the SMF provides an indication for UE-assistance in the ATSSS Rule to
the UE, as described in clause 5.32.8, and in the MAR to the UPF, as
described in clause 5.8.2.11.8.

If the UE receives the UE-assistance indicator in an ATSSS rule (as
specified in clause 5.32.8) and the UE decides to apply a different UL
traffic distribution for an SDF than the default UL traffic distribution
indicated in the Steering Mode component of the ATSSS rule (e.g. because
the UE is running out of battery), then the following applies:

\- The UE may apply any split percentages for the UL traffic
distribution of an SDF, based on implementation specific criteria.

\- The UE may send a PMF-UAD (UE Assistance Data) message to UPF that
contains the split percentages that may be used by UPF for all DL
traffic that the UE-assistance operation applies. The UPF acknowledges
the reception of the PMF-UAD message by sending a PMF-UAD complete
message to the UE.

NOTE: If the UE has multiple ATSSS rules that allow UE-assistance
operation, and the UE decides to use different UL split percentages for
their respective SDFs, then the split percentages included in the
PMF-UAD message are selected by the UE based on implementation specific
criteria.

\- The UPF may apply the information in a received PMF-UAD message to
align the DL traffic distribution for traffic that is allowed to use
UE-assistance operation, i.e. traffic where the MAR contains a Steering
Mode Indicator set to UE-assistance operation.

\- If the UE decides to terminate the UE assistance operation, the UE
may send a PMF-UAT (UE Assistance Termination) message to the UPF
indicating that the UE assistance operation is terminated and the UE
performs the UL traffic distribution according to the split percentages
in the ATSSS rule received from the network. If the UPF receives the
PMF-UAT message, the UPF acknowledges the reception by sending a PMF-UAT
complete message and performs DL traffic distribution by applying the
split percentages included in the MAR.

### 5.32.6 Support of Steering Functionalities

#### 5.32.6.1 General

The functionality in an ATSSS-capable UE that can steer, switch and
split the MA PDU Session traffic across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access,
is called a \"steering functionality\". An ATSSS-capable UE may support
one or more of the following types of steering functionalities:

\- High-layer steering functionalities, which operate above the IP
layer:

\- In this release of the specification, only one high-layer steering
functionality is specified, which applies the MPTCP protocol
(IETF RFC 8684 \[81\]) and is called \"MPTCP functionality\" (see
clause 5.32.6.2.1). This steering functionality can be applied to steer,
switch and split the TCP traffic of applications allowed to use MPTCP.
The MPTCP functionality in the UE may communicate with an associated
MPTCP Proxy functionality in the UPF, by using the MPTCP protocol over
the 3GPP and/or the non-3GPP user plane.

\- Low-layer steering functionalities, which operate below the IP layer:

\- One type of low-layer steering functionality defined in the present
document is called \"ATSSS Low-Layer functionality\", or ATSSS-LL
functionality (see clause 5.32.6.3.1). This steering functionality can
be applied to steer, switch and split all types of traffic, including
TCP traffic, UDP traffic, Ethernet traffic, etc. ATSSS-LL functionality
is mandatory for MA PDU Session of type Ethernet. In the network, there
shall be in the data path of the MA PDU session one UPF supporting
ATSSS-LL.

NOTE: Filters used in ATSSS rules related with a MA PDU Session of type
Ethernet can refer to IP level parameters such as IP addresses and
TCP/UDP ports.

The UE indicates to the network its supported steering functionalities
and steering modes by including in the UE ATSSS Capability one of the
following:

1\) ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode.

In this case, the UE indicates that it is capable to steer, switch and
split all traffic of the MA PDU Session by using the ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode specified in clause 5.32.8.

2\) MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
functionality with only Active-Standby steering mode.

In this case, the UE indicates that:

a\) it is capable to steer, switch and split the MPTCP traffic of the MA
PDU Session by using the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode
specified in clause 5.32.8; and

b\) it is capable to steer and switch all other traffic (i.e. the
non-MPTCP traffic) of the MA PDU Session by using the ATSSS-LL
functionality with the Active-Standby steering mode specified in
clause 5.32.8.

3\) MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode.

In this case, the UE indicates that:

a\) it is capable to steer, switch and split the MPTCP traffic of the MA
PDU Session by using the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode
specified in clause 5.32.8; and

b\) it is capable to steer, switch and split all other traffic (i.e. the
non-MPTCP traffic) of the MA PDU Session by using the ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode specified in clause 5.32.8.

The above steering functionalities are schematically illustrated in the
Figure 5.32.6.1-1, which shows an example model for an ATSSS-capable UE
supporting the MPTCP functionality and the ATSSS-LL functionality. The
MPTCP flows in this figure represent the traffic of the applications for
which MPTCP can be applied. The three different IP addresses illustrated
in the UE are further described in clause 5.32.6.2.1. The \"Low-Layer\"
in this figure contains functionality that operates below the IP layer
(e.g. different network interfaces in the UE), while the \"High-Layer\"
contains functionality that operates above the IP layer.

Figure 5.32.6.1-1: Steering functionalities in an example UE model

Within the same MA PDU Session in the UE, it is possible to steer the
MPTCP flows by using the MPTCP functionality and, simultaneously, to
steer all other flows by using the ATSSS-LL functionality. For the same
packet flow, only one steering functionality shall be used.

All steering functionalities in the UE shall take ATSSS decisions (i.e.
decide how to steer, switch and split the traffic) by using the same set
of ATSSS rules. Similarly, all ATSSS decisions in the UPF shall be taken
by applying the same set of N4 rules, which support ATSSS. The ATSSS
rules and the N4 rules supporting ATSSS are provisioned in the UE and in
the UPF respectively, when the MA PDU Session is established.

If the UE supports both the MPTCP functionality and the ATSSS-LL
functionality, it shall use the provisioned ATSSS rules (see
TS 23.503 \[45\]) to decide which steering functionality to apply for a
specific packet flow.

#### 5.32.6.2 High-Layer Steering Functionalities

##### 5.32.6.2.1 MPTCP Functionality

As mentioned in clause 5.32.6.1, the MPTCP functionality in the UE
applies the MPTCP protocol (IETF RFC 8684 \[81\]) and the provisioned
ATSSS rules for performing access traffic steering, switching and
splitting. The MPTCP functionality in the UE may communicate with the
MPTCP Proxy functionality in the UPF using the user plane of the 3GPP
access, or the non-3GPP access, or both.

The MPTCP functionality may be enabled in the UE when the UE provides an
\"MPTCP capability\" during PDU Session Establishment procedure.

The network shall not enable the MPTCP functionality when the type of
the MA PDU Session is Ethernet.

If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the MPTCP functionality,
as described in clause 5.32.2, and the network agrees to enable the
MPTCP functionality for the MA PDU Session then:

i\) An associated MPTCP Proxy functionality is enabled in the UPF for
the MA PDU Session by MPTCP functionality indication received in the
Multi-Access Rules (MAR).

ii\) The network allocates to UE one IP address/prefix for the MA PDU
Session and two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called \"link-specific
multipath\" addresses/prefixes; one associated with 3GPP access and
another associated with the non-3GPP access. In the UE, these two IP
addresses/prefixes are used only by the MPTCP functionality. Each
\"link-specific multipath\" address/prefix assigned to UE may not be
routable via N6. The MPTCP functionality in the UE and the MPTCP Proxy
functionality in the UPF shall use the \"link-specific multipath\"
addresses/prefixes for subflows over non-3GPP access and over 3GPP
access and MPTCP Proxy functionality shall use the IP address/prefix of
the MA PDU session for the communication with the final destination. In
Figure 5.32.6.1-1, the IP@3 corresponds to the IP address of the MA PDU
Session and the IP@1 and IP@2 correspond to the \"link-specific
multipath\" IP addresses. The following UE IP address management
applies:

\- The MA PDU IP address/prefix shall be provided to the UE via
mechanisms defined in clause 5.8.2.2.

\- The \"link-specific multipath\" IP addresses/prefixes shall be
allocated by the UPF and shall be provided to the UE via SM NAS
signalling.

NOTE 1: After the MA PDU Session is released, the same UE IP
addresses/prefixes is not allocated to another UE for MA PDU Session in
a short time.

NOTE 2: The act of the UPF performing translation on traffic associated
with the \"link-specific multipath\" addresses to/from the MA PDU
session IP address can lead to TCP port collision and exhaustion. The
port collision can potentially occur because the UE also uses the MA PDU
session IP address for non-MPTCP traffic, and this causes the port
namespace of such address to be owned simultaneously by the UE and UPF.
In addition, the port exhaustion can potentially occur when the UE
creates a large number of flows, because multiple IP addresses used by
the UE are mapped to a single MA PDU session IP address on the UPF. The
UPF needs to consider these problems based on the UPF implementation,
and avoid them by, for example, using additional N6-routable IP
addresses for traffic associated to the link-specific multipath
addresses/prefixes. How this is done is left to the implementation.

iii\) The network shall send MPTCP proxy information to UE, i.e. the IP
address, a port number and the type of the MPTCP proxy. The following
type of MPTCP proxy shall be supported in this release:

\- Type 1: Transport Converter, as defined in IETF RFC 8803 \[82\].

The MPTCP proxy information is retrieved by the SMF from the UPF during
N4 session establishment.

The UE shall support the client extensions specified in
IETF RFC 8803 \[82\].

iv\) The network may indicate to UE the list of applications for which
the MPTCP functionality should be applied. This is achieved by using the
Steering Functionality component of an ATSSS rule (see clause 5.32.8).

NOTE 3: To protect the MPTCP proxy function (e.g. to block DDOS to the
MPTCP proxy function), the IP addresses of the MPTCP Proxy Function are
only accessible from the two \"link-specific multipath\" IP addresses of
the UE via the N3/N9 interface.

v\) When the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the MPTCP
functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL functionality with
only the Active-Standby steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1)
and these functionalities are enabled for the MA PDU Session, then the
UE shall route via the MA PDU Session the TCP traffic of applications
for which the MPTCP functionality should be applied (i.e. the MPTCP
traffic), as defined in bullet iv. The UE may route all other traffic
(i.e. the non-MPTCP traffic) via the MA PDU Session, but this type of
traffic shall be routed on one of 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, based
on the received ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP traffic (see clause 5.32.2).
The UPF shall route all other traffic (i.e. non-MPTCP traffic) based on
the N4 rules provided by the SMF. This may include N4 rules for
ATSSS-LL, using any steering mode as instructed by the N4 rules.

#### 5.32.6.3 Low-Layer Steering Functionalities

##### 5.32.6.3.1 ATSSS-LL Functionality

The ATSSS-LL functionality in the UE does not apply a specific protocol.
It is a data switching function, which decides how to steer, switch and
split the uplink traffic across 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, based on the
provisioned ATSSS rules and local conditions (e.g. signal loss
conditions). The ATSSS-LL functionality in the UE may be applied to
steer, switch and split all types of traffic, including TCP traffic, UDP
traffic, Ethernet traffic, etc.

The ATSSS-LL functionality may be enabled in the UE when the UE provides
an \"ATSSS-LL capability\" during the PDU Session Establishment
procedure.

The ATSSS-LL functionality is mandatory in the UE for MA PDU Session of
type Ethernet. When the UE does not support the MPTCP functionality, the
ATSSS-LL functionality is mandatory in the UE for an MA PDU Session of
type IP. When the UE supports the MPTCP functionality, the ATSSS-LL
functionality with Active-Standby Steering Mode is mandatory in the UE
for an MA PDU Session of type IP to support non-MPTCP traffic.

The network shall also support the ATSSS-LL functionality as defined for
the UE. The ATSSS-LL functionality in the UPF is enabled for a MA PDU
Session by ATSSS-LL functionality indication received in the
Multi-Access Rules (MAR).

### 5.32.7 Interworking with EPS

#### 5.32.7.1 General

Multi-access connectivity using ATSSS via EPC only is not supported.

Interworking for MA PDU Session, if allowed by the network, is based on
the interworking functionality specified in clause 5.17.2, with the
differences and clarifications described in the following clauses.

A PDN Connection in EPS may be modified into a MA PDU Session when
transferred to 5GS if the UE and the SMF+PGW-C support the ATSSS
feature.

#### 5.32.7.2 Interworking with N26 Interface

Interworking with N26 interface is based on clause 5.17.2.2, with the
following differences and clarifications:

\- When the UE is registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses, and the UE request a new MA PDU Session via non-3GPP access,
the AMF also includes the indication of interworking with N26 to SMF.

\- The SMF does not request EBI allocation when MA PDU Session is
established only over non-3GPP access. If MA PDU Session is released
over 3GPP access, the allocated EBI(s) for the MA PDU Session is revoked
by the SMF as described in clause 4.11.1.4.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- The SMF does not request EBI allocation for GBR QoS Flow if the GBR
QoS Flow is only allowed over non-3GPP access.

\- If the UE and the network support MA PDU Sessions with 3GPP access
connected to EPC, the MA PDU Session may be simultaneously associated
with user-plane resources on 3GPP access network connected to EPC and
with non-3GPP access network connected to 5GC. This case is further
described in clause 5.32.1 and in clause 4.22.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- If the UE or the network does not support MA PDU Session with 3GPP
access connected to EPC, the MA PDU Session is handled as follows:

\- When UE moves from 5GS to EPS, for both idle mode and connected mode
mobility, if the MA PDU Session is moved to EPS as a PDN connection, the
SMF triggers PDU Session Release procedure to release the MA PDU Session
over Non-3GPP access in 5GS. UE and SMF remove ATSSS related contexts
e.g. ATSSS rules, Measurement Assistance Information.

\- When UE moves from 5GS to EPS, for both idle mode and connected mode
mobility, if the MA PDU Session is not moved to EPS as a PDN connection,
the 3GPP access of this MA PDU session becomes unavailable and the AMF
notifies the SMF. In turn, the SMF may decide to move the traffic to
Non-3GPP access of the MA PDU session, if it is available. When UE moves
back from EPS to 5GS, after the UE is registered over the 3GPP, the UE
may add user-plane resources over the 3GPP access to the MA PDU session
by triggering PDU Session Establishment procedure as specified in
clause 5.32.2.

\- After UE moves from EPS to 5GS, for both idle mode and connected mode
mobility, if the UE requires MA PDU session, or if no policy in the UE
(e.g. no URSP rule) and no local restrictions mandate a single access
for the PDU Session, UE triggers the PDU Session Modification procedure
as described in clause 4.22.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\] to provide the ATSSS
Capability to SMF+PGW-C. The SMF+PGW-C may determine whether to modify
this PDU Session to a MA PDU Session in 5GS, e.g. based on SMF+PGW-C and
UE\'s ATSSS Capability, subscription data and local policy. If dynamic
PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the PCF decides whether the MA
PDU session is allowed or not based on operator policy and subscription
data. If the MA PDU Session is allowed, the SMF provides ATSSS rule(s)
and Measurement Assistance Information to the UE. If the UE receives
ATSSS rules and is not registered to non-3GPP access, the UE establishes
the second user-plane over non-3GPP access after the UE is registered to
non-3GPP access. If UE was registered to non-3GPP access in 5GS, the UP
resources over non-3GPP access are also established by the SMF using the
PDU Session Modification procedure.

#### 5.32.7.3 Interworking without N26 Interface

Interworking without N26 interface is based on clause 5.17.2.3, with the
following differences and clarifications:

\- After UE moves from 5GS to EPS, UE may send a PDN Connectivity
Request with \"handover\" indication to transfer the MA PDU Session to
EPS. Then, if the UE or the network does not support MA PDU Session with
3GPP access connected to EPC, the SMF+PGW-C triggers to release MA PDU
in 5GS. If UE does not transfer the MA PDU Session to EPS, UE keeps the
MA PDU Session in 5GS. If the UE and the network support MA PDU Session
with 3GPP access connected to EPC, the UE includes a \"handover\"
indication and a \"MA PDU Request\" indication as well as the PDU
Session ID in the PCO and the SMF+PGW-C keeps the user-plane resources
over non-3GPP access in 5GC as described in clause 4.22.6.2.5 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. In this case, UE may report to UPF that 3GPP access is
unavailable, all MA PDU Session traffic is transported over N3GPP
access. Later, if UE returns to 5GS, UE may report the 3GPP access
availability to UPF.

\- After UE moves from EPS to 5GS, UE may trigger PDU Session
Establishment procedure to transfer the PDN Connection to 5GS. During
the PDU Session Establishment procedure, if the PDN Connection was not
used as the 3GPP access leg of the MA PDU Session, the UE may request to
establish a MA PDU Session by including \"MA PDU Request\" or, if no
policy in the UE (e.g. no URSP rule) and no local restrictions mandate a
single access for the PDU Session, the UE may include the \"MA PDU
Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication.

### 5.32.8 ATSSS Rules

As specified in clause 5.32.3, after the establishment of a MA PDU
Session, the UE receives a prioritized list of ATSSS rules from the SMF.
The structure of an ATSSS rule is specified in Table 5.32.8-1.

The UE evaluates the ATSSS rules in priority order.

Each ATSSS rule contains a Traffic Descriptor (containing one or more
components described in Table 5.32.8-1) that determines when the rule is
applicable. An ATSSS rule is determined to be applicable when every
component in the Traffic Descriptor matches the considered service data
flow (SDF).

Depending on the type of the MA PDU Session, the Traffic Descriptor may
contain the following components (the details of the Traffic Descriptor
generation are described in clause 5.32.3):

\- For IPv4, or IPv6, or IPv4v6 type: Application descriptors and/or IP
descriptors.

\- For Ethernet type: Application descriptors and/or Non-IP descriptors.

One ATSSS rule with a \"match all\" Traffic Descriptor may be provided,
which matches all SDFs. When provided, it shall have the least Rule
Precedence value, so it shall be the last one evaluated by the UE.

NOTE 1: The format of the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor of an ATSSS
rule is defined in stage-3.

Each ATSSS rule contains an Access Selection Descriptor that contains
the following components:

\- A Steering Mode, which determines how the traffic of the matching SDF
should be distributed across 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. The following
Steering Modes are supported:

\- Active-Standby: It is used to steer a SDF on one access (the Active
access), when this access is available, and to switch the SDF to the
available other access (the Standby access), when Active access becomes
unavailable. When the Active access becomes available again, the SDF is
switched back to this access. If the Standby access is not defined, then
the SDF is only allowed on the Active access and cannot be transferred
on another access.

\- Smallest Delay: It is used to steer a SDF to the access that is
determined to have the smallest Round-Trip Time (RTT). As defined in
clause 5.32.5, measurements may be obtained by the UE and UPF to
determine the RTT over 3GPP access and over non-3GPP access. In
addition, if one access becomes unavailable, all SDF traffic is switched
to the other available access. It can only be used for the Non-GBR SDF.

\- Load-Balancing: It is used to split a SDF across both accesses if
both accesses are available. It contains the percentage of the SDF
traffic that should be sent over 3GPP access and over non-3GPP access.
Load-Balancing is only applicable to Non-GBR SDF. In addition, if one
access becomes unavailable, all SDF traffic is switched to the other
available access, as if the percentage of the SDF traffic transported
via the available access was 100%.

\- Priority-based: It is used to steer all the traffic of an SDF to the
high priority access, until this access is determined to be congested.
In this case, the traffic of the SDF is sent also to the low priority
access, i.e. the SDF traffic is split over the two accesses. In
addition, when the high priority access becomes unavailable, all SDF
traffic is switched to the low priority access. How UE and UPF determine
when a congestion occurs on an access is implementation dependent. It
can only be used for the Non-GBR SDF.

\- A Steering Mode Indicator, which indicates that the UE may change the
default steering parameters provided in the Steering Mode component and
may adjust the traffic steering based on its own decisions. Only one of
the following Steering Mode Indicators may be provided:

\- Autonomous load-balance indicator: This indicator may be provided
only when the Steering Mode is Load-Balancing. When provided, the UE may
ignore the percentages in the Steering Mode component (i.e. the default
percentages provided by the network) and may autonomously determine its
own percentages for traffic splitting, in a way that maximizes the
aggregated bandwidth in the uplink direction. The UE is expected to
determine its own percentages for traffic splitting by performing
measurements across the two accesses. The UPF may apply a similar
behaviour when the autonomous load-balance indicator is included in an
N4 rule.

\- UE-assistance indicator: This indicator may be provided only when the
Steering Mode is Load-Balancing. When provided by the network, it
indicates that (a) the UE may decide how to distribute the UL traffic of
the matching SDF based on the UE\'s internal state (e.g. when the UE is
in the special internal state, e.g. lower battery level), and that (b)
the UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of
the matching SDF. In the normal cases, although with this indicator
provided, the UE shall distribute the UL traffic as indicated by the
network.

NOTE 2: Typically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for SDFs
for which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,
when the network has no strong steering requirements for the default
traffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this
traffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -
50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other
split percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to
optimize its operation (e.g. to minimize its battery consumption).

\- Threshold Values: One or more threshold values may be provided when
the Steering Mode is Priority-based or when the Steering Mode is
Load-Balancing with fixed split percentages (i.e. without the Autonomous
load-balance indicator or UE assistance indicator). A threshold value
may be either a value for RTT or a value for Packet Loss Rate. The
threshold values are applicable to both accesses and are applied by the
UE and UPF as follows:

\- Load-Balancing Steering Mode with fixed split percentages (i.e.
without the Autonomous load-balance indicator or UE assistance
indicator): When at least one measured parameter (i.e. RTT or Packet
Loss Rate) on one access exceeds the provided threshold value, the UE
and UPF may stop sending traffic on this access, or may continue sending
traffic on this access but should reduce the traffic on this access by
an implementation specific amount and shall send the amount of reduced
traffic on the other access. When all measured parameters (i.e. RTT and
Packet Loss Rate) for both accesses do not exceed the provided threshold
values, the UE and UPF shall apply the fixed split percentages.

\- Priority-based Steering Mode: When one or more threshold values are
provided for the Priority-based Steering Mode, these threshold values
should be considered by UE and UPF to determine when an access becomes
congested. For example, when a measured parameter (i.e. RTT or Packet
Loss Rate) on one access exceeds the provided threshold value, the UE
and UPF may consider this access as congested and send the traffic also
to the low priority access.

\- A Steering Functionality, which identifies whether the MPTCP
functionality or the ATSSS-LL functionality should be used to steer the
traffic of the matching SDF. This is used when the UE supports multiple
functionalities for ATSSS, as specified in clause 5.32.6 (\"Support of
Steering Functions\").

NOTE 3: There is no need to update the ATSSS rules when one access
becomes unavailable or available.

As an example, the following ATSSS rules could be provided to UE:

a\) \"Traffic Descriptor: UDP, DestAddr 1.2.3.4\", \"Steering Mode:
Active-Standby, Active=3GPP, Standby=non-3GPP\":

\- This rule means \"steer UDP traffic with destination IP address
1.2.3.4 to the active access (3GPP), if available. If the active access
is not available, use the standby access (non-3GPP)\".

b\) \"Traffic Descriptor: TCP, DestPort 8080\", \"Steering Mode:
Smallest Delay\":

\- This rule means \"steer TCP traffic with destination port 8080 to the
access with the smallest delay\". The UE needs to measure the RTT over
both accesses, in order to determine which access has the smallest
delay.

c\) \"Traffic Descriptor: Application-1\", \"Steering Mode:
Load-Balancing, 3GPP=20%, non-3GPP=80%\", \"Steering Functionality:
MPTCP\":

\- This rule means \"send 20% of the traffic of Application-1 to 3GPP
access and 80% to non-3GPP access by using the MPTCP functionality\".

d\) \"Traffic Descriptor: Application-1\", \"Steering Mode:
Load-Balancing, 3GPP=20%, non-3GPP=80%, \"Threshold Value for Packet
Loss Rate: 1%\", \"Steering Functionality: MPTCP\":

\- This rule means \"send 20% of the traffic of Application-1 to 3GPP
access and 80% to non-3GPP access as long as the Packet Loss Rate does
not exceed 1% on both accesses, by using the MPTCP functionality. If the
measured Packet Loss Rate of an access exceeds 1%, then the traffic of
Application-1 may be reduced on this access and sent via the other
access\".

## 5.33 Support for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication

### 5.33.1 General

The following features described in 5.33 may be used to enhance 5GS to
support Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC):

\- Redundant transmission for high reliability communication.

In this Release, URLLC applies to 3GPP access only.

When a PDU Session is to serve URLLC QoS Flow, the UE and SMF should
establish the PDU Session as always-on PDU Session as described in
clause 5.6.13.

NOTE 1: How the UE knows whether a PDU Session is to serve a URLLC QoS
Flow when triggering PDU Session establishment is up to UE
implementation.

NOTE 2: No additional functionality is specified for URLLC in order to
support Home Routed roaming scenario in this Release.

### 5.33.2 Redundant transmission for high reliability communication

#### 5.33.2.1 Dual Connectivity based end to end Redundant User Plane Paths

In order to support highly reliable URLLC services, a UE may set up two
redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network, such that the 5GS sets up
the user plane paths of the two redundant PDU Sessions to be disjoint.
The user\'s subscription indicates if user is allowed to have redundant
PDU Sessions and this indication is provided to SMF from UDM.

NOTE 1: It is out of scope of 3GPP how to make use of the duplicate
paths for redundant traffic delivery end-to-end. It is possible to rely
on upper layer protocols, such as the IEEE 802.1 TSN (Time Sensitive
Networking) FRER (Frame Replication and Elimination for
Reliability) \[83\], to manage the replication and elimination of
redundant packets/frames over the duplicate paths which can span both
the 3GPP segments and possibly fixed network segments as well.

NOTE 2: The following redundant network deployment aspects are within
the responsibility of the operator and are not subject to 3GPP
standardization:

\- RAN supports dual connectivity, and there is sufficient RAN coverage
for dual connectivity in the target area.

\- UEs support dual connectivity.

\- The core network UPF deployment is aligned with RAN deployment and
supports redundant user plane paths.

\- The underlying transport topology is aligned with the RAN and UPF
deployment and supports redundant user plane paths.

\- The physical network topology and geographical distribution of
functions also supports the redundant user plane paths to the extent
deemed necessary by the operator.

\- The operation of the redundant user plane paths is made sufficiently
independent, to the extent deemed necessary by the operator, e.g.
independent power supplies.

Figure 5.33.2.1-1 illustrates an example user plane resource
configuration of dual PDU Sessions when redundancy is applied. One PDU
Session spans from the UE via Master NG-RAN to UPF1 acting as the PDU
Session Anchor, and the other PDU Session spans from the UE via
Secondary NG-RAN to UPF2 acting as the PDU Session Anchor. As described
in TS 37.340 \[31\], NG-RAN may realize redundant user plane resources
for the two PDU Sessions with two NG-RAN nodes (i.e. Master NG-RAN and
Secondary NG-RAN as shown in Figure 5.33.2.1-1) or a single NG-RAN node.
In both cases, there is a single N1 interface towards AMF.

Based on these two PDU Sessions, two independent user plane paths are
set up. UPF1 and UPF2 connect to the same Data Network (DN), even though
the traffic via UPF1 and UPF2 may be routed via different user plane
nodes within the DN.

In order to establish two redundant PDU Sessions and associate the
duplicated traffic coming from the same application to these PDU
Sessions, URSP as specified in TS 23.503 \[45\] may be used, or
alternatively the UE may perform this task independently from URSP.

When URSP is used to establish two redundant PDU Sessions, duplicated
traffic from the application, associated to the redundant PDU Sessions,
is differentiated by two distinct traffic descriptors, each in a
distinct URSP rule. These traffic descriptors need to have different
DNNs, IP descriptors or non-IP descriptors (e.g. MAC address, VLAN ID),
so that the two redundant PDU Sessions are matched to the Route
Selection Descriptors of distinct URSP rules. These Route Selection
Descriptors of distinct URSP rules may include corresponding RSNs and
PDU Session Pair IDs. The Route Selection Descriptors share same PDU
Session Pair ID, if included, to denote the two traffic are redundant
with each other. How does UE determines the PDU Session Pair ID and/or
RSN from the matched URSP rules is described in clause 6.6.2 of
TS 23.503 \[45\].

When the UE performs the establishment of two redundant PDU Sessions and
the duplication of traffic independently from URSP, the UE may establish
two redundant PDU Sessions even when the application does not duplicate
the traffic and the application does not provide two distinct traffic
descriptors. In this case the UE may set the RSN and PDU Session Pair ID
in the PDU Session Establishment Request message based on UE
implementation.

NOTE 3: As an example, the UE may use the implementation of FRER (Frame
Replication and Elimination for Reliability),
IEEE Std 802.1CB-2017 \[83\], in the UE\'s operating system.

If the operator decides to allow UE to use its own mechanisms to
determine PDU Session Pair ID and RSN (where such UE capability is known
based on local PCF configuration based on e.g. deployment, terminal
implementation or policies per group of UE(s)), then the PCF shall not
include PDU Session Pair ID and RSN in URSP rule.

The redundant user plane set up applies to both IP and Ethernet PDU
Sessions.

\- UE initiates two redundant PDU Sessions and may provide PDU Session
Pair ID (optional) and the RSN (optional). Different combinations of
RSN, DNN and S-NSSAI are used for each PDU Session within a given pair
of redundant PDU Sessions. Different combinations of PDU Session Pair
ID, DNN and S-NSSAI are used between the different pairs of redundant
PDU Session.

\- The UE may include a PDU Session Pair ID and/or RSN in each of the
PDU Session establishment Request when it establishes redundant PDU
Sessions. UE determines the PDU Session Pair ID and/or RSN based on UE
local mechanism or the matched URSP rules.

\- The SMF determines whether the PDU Session is to be handled
redundantly. The determination is based on the presence of the PDU
Session Pair ID and/or RSN in the PDU Session Establishment Request or
the determination is based on an indication that redundant PDU Session
is required provided by PCF for the PDU Session, if dynamic PCC applies
for the PDU Session or the combination of the S-NSSAI, DNN, user
subscription and local policy configuration in the SMF if dynamic PCC is
not used for the PDU Session. If the PDU session is to be handled
redundantly and the PDU Session Pair ID was not included in the PDU
Session Establishment request, the SMF uses S-NSSAI, DNN and local
configuration to determine the PDU Session Pair ID. If the PDU session
is to be handled redundantly and RSN was not included in the PDU Session
Establishment request, the SMF uses S-NSSAI, DNN to determine the RSN
value. The RSN differentiates the PDU Sessions that are handled
redundantly and indicates redundant user plane requirements for the PDU
Sessions in NG-RAN.

\- The SMF shall provide the RSN and PDU Session Pair ID to the NG-RAN
for a redundant PDU Session.

\- Operator configuration of UPF selection ensures the appropriate UPF
selection for disjoint paths.

\- At establishment of the PDU Sessions or at transitions to
CM-CONNECTED state, the RSN parameter indicates to NG-RAN that redundant
user plane resources shall be provided for the given PDU Sessions by
means of dual connectivity. The PDU Session Pair ID identifies the two
redundant PDU Sessions that belong together. The value of the RSN
parameter and the PDU Session Pair ID indicates redundant user plane
requirements for the PDU Sessions. This request for redundant handling
is made by indicating the RSN to the NG-RAN node on a per PDU Session
granularity. PDU Sessions associated with different RSN values shall be
realized by different, redundant UP resources. Based on the RSN, the PDU
Session Pair ID and RAN configuration, the NG-RAN sets up dual
connectivity as defined in TS 37.340 \[31\] so that the sessions have
end to end redundant paths. When there are multiple PDU Sessions with
the RSN parameter set, of different values of RSN and the same PDU
Session Pair ID, this indicates to NG-RAN that CN is requesting dual
connectivity to be set up and the user plane shall be handled as
indicated by the RSN parameter, the PDU Session Pair ID and the
associated RAN configuration. If the RSN value and PDU Session Pair ID
are provided to the NG-RAN, NG-RAN shall consider the RSN value and PDU
Session Pair ID when it associates the PDU Sessions with NG-RAN UP.

NOTE 4: The decision to set up dual connectivity remains in NG-RAN as
defined today. NG-RAN takes into account the additional request for the
dual connectivity setup provided by the CN.

\- Using NG-RAN local configuration, NG-RAN determines whether the
request to establish RAN resources for a PDU Session is fulfilled or not
considering user plane requirements indicated by the RSN parameter and
the PDU Session Pair ID by means of dual connectivity. If the request to
establish RAN resources for PDU Session can be fulfilled by the RAN, the
PDU Session is established even if the user plane requirements indicated
by RSN cannot be satisfied. The decision for each PDU Session is taken
independently (i.e. rejection of a PDU Session request shall not release
the previously established PDU Session). The RAN shall determine whether
to notify the SMF if the RAN resources indicated by the RSN parameter
and the PDU Session Pair ID can no longer be maintained and SMF can use
that to determine if the PDU Session should be released.

\- In the case of Ethernet PDU Sessions, the SMF has the possibility to
change the UPF (acting as the PSA) and select a new UPF based on the
identity of the Secondary NG-RAN for the second PDU Session if the
Secondary NG-RAN is modified (or added/released), using the Ethernet PDU
Session Anchor Relocation procedure described in clause 4.3.5.8 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- The SMF\'s charging record may reflect the RSN information.

\- The RSN parameter and the PDU Session Pair ID, if available, is
transferred from Source NG-RAN to Target NG-RAN in the case of handover.

#### 5.33.2.2 Support of redundant transmission on N3/N9 interfaces

If the reliability of NG-RAN node, UPF and CP NFs are high enough to
fulfil the reliability requirement of URLLC services served by these
NFs, but the reliability of single N3 tunnel is considered not high
enough, e.g. due to the deployment environment of backhaul network, the
redundant transmission may be deployed between PSA UPF and NG-RAN via
two independent N3 tunnels, which are associated with a single PDU
Session, over different transport layer path to enhance the reliability.
SMF may make use of Redundant Transmission Experience analytics provided
by NWDAF, as described in clause 6.13 of TS 23.288 \[86\], to determine
whether redundant transmission for the PDU session of the URLLC shall be
performed or (if activated) shall be stopped.

To ensure the two N3 tunnels are transferred via disjointed transport
layer paths, the SMF or PSA UPF should provide different routing
information in the tunnel information (e.g. different IP addresses or
different Network Instances), and these routing information should be
mapped to disjoint transport layer paths according to network deployment
configuration. The SMF indicates NG-RAN and PSA UPF that one of the two
CN/AN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session
accordingly. The redundant transmission using the two N3/N9 tunnels are
performed at QoS Flow granularity and are sharing the same QoS Flow ID.

During or after a URLLC QoS Flow establishment, if the SMF decided that
redundant transmission shall be performed based on authorized 5QI,
NG-RAN node capability, operator configuration and/or Redundant
Transmission Experience analytics, the SMF informs the PSA UPF and
NG-RAN to perform redundant transmission via N4 interface and N2
information accordingly. In this case, NG-RAN should also provide
different routing information in the tunnel information (e.g. different
IP addresses), and these routing information should be mapped to
disjoint transport layer paths according to network deployment
configuration.

NOTE 1: The NG-RAN node capability to support the redundant transmission
on N3/N9 can be configured in the SMF per network slice or per SMF
service area.

If duplication transmission is performed on N3/N9 interface, for each
downlink packet of the QoS Flow the PSA UPF received from DN, the PSA
UPF replicates the packet and assigns the same GTP-U sequence number to
them for the redundant transmission. The NG-RAN eliminates the
duplicated packets based on the GTP-U sequence number and then forwards
the PDU to the UE.

For each uplink packet of the QoS Flow the NG-RAN received from UE, the
NG-RAN replicates the packet and assigns the same GTP-U sequence number
to them for redundant transmission. These packets are transmitted to the
PSA UPF via two N3 Tunnels separately. The PSA UPF eliminates the
duplicated packet based on the GTP-U sequence number accordingly.

NOTE 2: How to realize the sequence number for support of GTP-U
duplication over N3/N9 is up to stage 3.

NOTE 3: For redundant transmission on N3/N9 interfaces, reordering is
not required on the receiver side.

The PSA UPF and NG-RAN may transmit packets via one or both of the
tunnels per QoS Flow based on SMF instruction.

NOTE 4: The AMF selects an SMF supporting redundant transmission based
on the requested S-NSSAI and/or DNN.

During UE mobility, when the UE moves from NG-RAN supporting redundant
transmission to NG-RAN not supporting redundant transmission, the SMF
may release the QoS Flow which are subject to redundant transmission.

Figure 5.33.2.2-1 illustrates the case that the redundant transmission
is performed only on N3 interface. These packets are transmitted to the
NG-RAN via two N3 Tunnels separately. The RAN node and PSA UPF shall
support the packet replication and elimination function as described
above.

![](media/image82.emf)

Figure 5.33.2.2-1: Redundant transmission with two N3 tunnels between
the PSA UPF and a single NG-RAN node

Two Intermediate UPFs (I-UPFs) between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN may be
used to support the redundant transmission based on two N3 and N9
tunnels between a single NG-RAN node and the PSA UPF. The NG-RAN node
and PSA UPF shall support the packet replication and elimination
function as described above.

![](media/image83.emf)

Figure 5.33.2.2-2: Two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and PSA UPF for
redundant transmission

In figure 5.33.2.2-2, there are two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and
PSA UPF for the URLLC QoS Flow(s) of the same PDU Session for redundant
transmission established during or after a URLLC QoS Flow establishment.
In the case of downlink traffic, the PSA UPF duplicates the downlink
packet of the QoS Flow from the DN and assigns the same GTP-U sequence
number to them. These duplicated packets are transmitted to I-UPF1 and
I-UPF2 via N9 Tunnel 1 and N9 Tunnel 2 separately. Each I-UPF forwards
the packet with the same GTP-U sequence number which receives from the
PSA UPF to NG-RAN via N3 Tunnel 1 and N3 Tunnel 2 respectively. The
NG-RAN eliminates the duplicated packet based on the GTP-U sequence
number. In the case of uplink traffic, the NG-RAN duplicates the packet
of the QoS Flow from the UE and assigns the same GTP-U sequence number
to them. These duplicated packets are transmitted to I-UPF1 and I-UPF2
via N3 Tunnel 1 and N3 Tunnel 2 separately. Each I-UPF forwards the
packet with the same GTP-U sequence number which receives from the
NG-RAN to PSA UPF via N9 Tunnel 1 and N9 Tunnel 2 respectively. The PSA
UPF eliminates the duplicated packets based on the GTP-U sequence
number.

The I-UPFs inserted on one leg of the redundant paths shall not behave
in an UL CL or Branching Point role.

#### 5.33.2.3 Support for redundant transmission at transport layer

Redundant transmission can be supported within the 5G System without
making any assumption on support for protocols such as IEEE FRER in the
application layer (DN only) at the same time it can be supported without
requiring redundant GTP-U tunnel over N3. The backhaul provides two
disjoint transport paths between UPF and NG-RAN. The redundancy
functionality within NG-RAN and UPF make use of the independent paths at
transport layer. Support of redundant transmission at transport layer
requires no 3GPP protocol impact.

Following are the required steps:

\- UE establishes the PDU session for URLLC services. Based on DNN,
S-NSSAI, knowledge of supporting redundant transmission at transport
layer and other factors as described in clause 6.3.3, SMF selects a UPF
that supports redundant transmission at transport layer for the PDU
session. One N3 GTP-U tunnel is established between UPF and NG-RAN.

The knowledge of supporting redundant transmission at transport layer
can be configured in the SMF, or be configured in UPF and then obtained
by the SMF via N4 capability negotiation during N4 Association setup
procedure.

\- For DL data transmission, UPF sends the DL packets on N3 GTP-U
tunnel. Redundant functionality in the UPF duplicates the DL data on the
transport layer. Redundant functionality in the NG-RAN eliminates the
received duplicated DL data and sends to NG-RAN.

\- For UL data transmission, NG-RAN sends the received UL packets on N3
GTP-U tunnel, the Redundant functionality in the NG-RAN performs the
redundant handling on the backhaul transport layer. The Redundant
functionality in the UPF eliminates the received duplicated UL data and
sends to UPF.

### 5.33.3 QoS Monitoring to Assist URLLC Service

#### 5.33.3.1 General

In this release, the QoS Monitoring is applied for packet delay
measurement. The packet delay between UE and PSA UPF is a combination of
the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay as defined in TS 38.314 \[120\] and
UL/DL packet delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF. The NG-RAN is required to
provide the QoS Monitoring on the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay
measurement. The QoS Monitoring on UL/DL packet delay between NG-RAN and
PSA UPF can be performed on different levels of granularities, i.e. per
QoS Flow per UE level, or per GTP-U path level, subject to the
operators\' configuration, and/or 3rd party application request, and/or
PCF policy control for the URLLC services.

The PCF generates the authorized QoS Monitoring policy for a service
data flow based on the QoS Monitoring request if received from the AF.
The PCF includes the authorized QoS Monitoring policy in the PCC rule
and provides it to the SMF.

#### 5.33.3.2 Per QoS Flow per UE QoS Monitoring

SMF may activate the end to end UL/DL packet delay measurement between
UE and PSA UPF for a QoS Flow during the PDU Session Establishment or
Modification procedure.

The SMF sends a QoS Monitoring request to the PSA UPF via N4 and NG-RAN
via N2 signalling to request the QoS monitoring between PSA UPF and
NG-RAN. The QoS Monitoring request may contain monitoring parameters
determined by SMF based on the authorized QoS Monitoring policy received
from the PCF and/or local configuration.

The NG-RAN initiates the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay measurement
based on the QoS Monitoring request from SMF. NG-RAN reports the RAN
part of UL/DL packet delay result to the PSA UPF in the UL data packet
or dummy UL packet.

If the NG-RAN and PSA UPF are time synchronised, the one way packet
delay monitoring between NG-RAN and PSA UPF is supported.

If the NG-RAN and PSA UPF are not time synchronised, it is assumed that
the UL packet delay and the DL packet delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF
are the same.

For both time synchronised and not time synchronised between NG-RAN and
PSA UPF, the PSA UPF creates and sends the monitoring packets to the RAN
in a measurement frequency, decided by the PSA UPF, taking the Reporting
frequency for QoS Monitoring received from the SMF into account:

\- The PSA UPF encapsulates in the GTP-U header with QFI, QoS Monitoring
Packet (QMP) indicator (which indicates the packet is used for UL/DL
packet delay measurement) and the local time T1 when the PSA UPF sends
out the DL monitoring packets.

\- The NG-RAN records the local time T1 received in the GTP-U header and
the local time T2 at the reception of the DL monitoring packets.

\- When receiving an UL packet from UE for that QFI or when the NG-RAN
sends a dummy UL packet as monitoring response (in case there is no UL
service packet for UL packet delay monitoring), the NG-RAN encapsulates
QMP indicator, the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay result, the time T1
received in the GTP-U header, the local time T2 at the reception of the
DL monitoring packet and the local time T3 when NG-RAN sends out this
monitoring response packet to the UPF via N3 interface, in the GTP-U
header of the monitoring response packet.

NOTE 1: When the NG-RAN sends the dummy UL packet as monitoring response
to PSA UPF depends on NG-RAN\'s implementation.

\- The PSA UPF records the local time T4 when receiving the monitoring
response packets and calculates the round trip (if not time
synchronized) or UL/DL packet delay (if time synchronized) between
NG-RAN and anchor PSA UPF based on the time information contained in the
GTP-U header of the received monitoring response packet. If the NG-RAN
and PSA UPF are not time synchronised, the PSA UPF calculates the UL/DL
packet delay between the NG-RAN and the PSA UPF based on the
(T2-T1+T4-T3)/2. If the NG-RAN and PSA UPF are time synchronised, the
PSA UPF calculates the UL packet delay and DL packet delay between the
NG-RAN and the PSA UPF based on (T4-T3) and (T2-T1), respectively. The
PSA UPF calculates the UL/DL packet delay between UE and PSA UPF based
on the received RAN part of UL/DL packet delay result and the calculated
UL/DL packet delay between RAN and PSA UPF. The PSA UPF reports the
result to the SMF based on some specific condition, e.g. when threshold
for reporting to SMF is reached.

NOTE 2: If the NG-RAN and PSA UPF are not time synchronised, it can
cause inaccurate result of UL/DL packet delay.

If the redundant transmission on N3/N9 interfaces is activated, the UPF
and NG-RAN performs QoS monitoring for both UP paths. The UPF reports
the packet delay of the two UP paths respectively to the SMF.

#### 5.33.3.3 GTP-U Path Monitoring

The SMF can request to activate QoS monitoring for the GTP-U path(s)
between all UPF(s) and the (R)AN based on locally configured policies.
Alternatively, when a QoS monitoring policy is received in a PCC rule
and the QoS monitoring is not yet active for the DSCP corresponding to
the 5QI in the PCC rule, the SMF activates QoS Monitoring for all UPFs
currently in use for this PDU Session and the (R)AN. In this case, the
SMF performs the QoS Flow Binding without taking the QoS Monitoring
Policy within the PCC rule into account. The SMF sends the QoS
monitoring policy to each involved UPF and the (R)AN via N4 interface
and via N2 interface respectively.

NOTE 1: The PCC rule containing a QoS monitoring policy is just a
trigger for the SMF to instruct the UPFs to initiate the GTP-U based QoS
Monitoring.

A GTP-U sender performs an estimation of RTT to a GTP-U receiver on a
GTP-U path by sending Echo messages and measuring time that elapses
between the transmission of Request message and the reception of
Response message. A GTP-U sender computes an accumulated packet delay by
adding RTT/2, the processing time and, if available, an accumulated
packet delay from an upstream GTP-U sender (i.e. an immediately
preceding GTP-U sender in user plane path) thus the measured accumulated
packet delay represents an estimated elapsed time since a user plane
packet entered 3GPP domain.

It is expected that a GTP-U sender determines RTT periodically in order
to detect changes in transport delays. QoS monitoring is performed by a
GTP-U end-point (UP function) that receives and stores QoS monitoring
policy including a packet delay budget parameter for a QoS Flow. QoS
monitoring is performed by comparing a measured accumulated packet delay
with the stored QoS parameter, i.e. packet delay budget. If the GTP-U
end-point (the PSA UPF, in the case of accumulated packet delay
reporting) determines that the packet delay exceeds the requested packet
delay budget, then the node triggers QoS monitoring alert signalling to
the relevant SMF or to the OA&M function.

NOTE 2: Echo Request message and Echo Response message are sent outside
GTP-U tunnels (the messages are using TEID set to 0). If underlying
transport is using QoS differentiation (e.g. IP DiffServ) then it is up
to the implementation to ensure that the Echo messages are classified
correctly and receive similar treatment by the underlaying transport as
GTP-U GTP-PDUs carrying QoS Flows (user data).

QoS Monitoring can be used to measure the packet delay for transport
paths and map the QoS Flows to appropriate network instance, DSCP values
as follows:

\- Packet delay measurement is performed by using GTP-U Echo
Request/Response as defined in the TS 28.552 \[108\], in the
corresponding user plane transport path(s), independent of the
corresponding PDU Session and the 5QI for a given QoS Flow, for a
specific URLLC service.

\- RAN measures and provides the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay towards
UPF (via N3).

\- The UPF calculates the UL/DL packet delay of N3/N9 interface (N9 is
applicable when I-UPF exists).

\- UPF reports QoS Monitoring result to the SMF based on some specific
conditions, e.g. first time, periodic, event triggered, when thresholds
for reporting towards SMF (via N4) are reached. The UPF may support
notification to the AF possibly via local NEF as described in clause 6.4
of TS 23.548 \[130\].

\- UPF does measurement of network hop delay per transport resources
that it will use towards a peer network node identified by an IP
destination address (the hop between these two nodes) and port. The
network hop measured delay is computed by sending an Echo Request over
such transport resource (Ti) and measuring RTT/2 when Echo Response is
received.

\- UPF maps {network instance, DSCP} into Transport Resource and
measures delay per IP destination address and port. Thus, for each IP
destination address, the measured delay per (network instance, DSCP)
entry is determined.

\- The UPF performing the QoS monitoring can provide the corresponding
{Network instance, DSCP} along with the measured accumulated packet
delay for the corresponding transport path to the SMF.

\- Based on this, SMF can determine QoS Flow mapping to the appropriate
{Network instance, DSCP} considering {5QI, QoS characteristics, ARP} for
the given QoS Flow.

## 5.34 Support of deployments topologies with specific SMF Service Areas

### 5.34.1 General

When the UE is outside of the SMF Service Area, or current SMF cannot
serve the target DNAI for the traffic routing for local access to the
DN, an I-SMF is inserted between the SMF and the AMF. The I-SMF has a
N11 interface with the AMF and a N16a interface with the SMF and is
responsible of controlling the UPF(s) that the SMF cannot directly
control. The exchange of the SM context and forwarding of tunnel
information if needed are done between two SMFs directly without
involvement of AMF.

Depending on scenario, a PDU Session in non-roaming case or local
breakout is either served by a single SMF or served by an SMF and an
I-SMF. When a PDU Session is served by both an SMF and an I-SMF, the SMF
is the NF instance that has the interfaces towards the PCF and CHF.

In this Release of the specification, deployments topologies with
specific SMF Service Areas apply only for 3GPP access.

The SMF shall release or reject the PDU Session if the DNN of the PDU
Session corresponds to a LADN and the I-SMF is inserted to the PDU
Session.

NOTE 1: This implies that operators need to plan the LADN deployment in
such a way that the LADN Service area needs to be within the SMF Service
Area, but not across SMFs\' Service Areas.

NOTE 2: This is to cover the case where the UE is not in or moves out of
SMF Service Area and an I-SMF is inserted to the PDU Session e.g. during
PDU Session Establishment, Service Request. If the PDU Session is
maintained with I-SMF, the SMF is not be able to enforce the LADN
Service control, e.g. SMF is not notified in the case of Service
Request.

Independent of whether deployments topologies with specific SMF Service
Areas apply, the SMF may trigger the PDU Session re-establishment to the
same DN, if the PDU Session is associated with the SSC mode 2 or SSC
mode 3.

NOTE 3: SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3 can be used to optimize SMF location
for a PDU Session and/or, depending on deployment, ensure that the UE is
always within the service area of the SMF controlling the PDU Session.
In this case (when PDU Session continuity over the PLMN is not required)
procedures described in this clause are not needed.

In this Release, how TSC (as defined in clauses 5.27 and 5.28) is
supported for PDU Sessions involving an I-SMF is not specified.

In this Release, Redundant User Plane Paths as defined in
clause 5.33.2.2 is not supported for PDU Sessions involving an I-SMF.

Redundant PDU sessions support as defined in clause 5.33.2.1 is
supported for PDU Sessions involving an I-SMF, when different S-NSSAIs
are used for the redundant PDU sessions.

Redundant User Plane Paths as defined in clause 5.33.2.3 is supported
for PDU Sessions involving an I-SMF only if this PDU session is
established for a S-NSSAI referring to network instances requiring
redundant transmission at transport layer.

QoS monitoring (as defined in clause 5.33.3) is supported as long as SMF
and not I-SMF initiates the QoS monitoring function.

Dynamic CN PDB provisioning (as defined in clause 5.7.3.4) is supported
for PDU Sessions involving an I-SMF.

In this Release, no dedicated functionality is specified for I-SMF and
N16a in order to support NPN.

### 5.34.2 Architecture

breakout scenario in reference point representation

For the case of home routed scenario, Figure 4.2.4-6 applies.

### 5.34.3 I-SMF selection, V-SMF reselection

The AMF is responsible of detecting when to add or to remove an I-SMF or
a V-SMF for a PDU Session. For this purpose, the AMF gets from NRF
information about the Service Area and supported DNAI(s) of SMF(s).

During mobility events such as Hand-Over or AMF change, if the service
area of the SMF does not include the new UE location, then the AMF
selects and inserts an I-SMF which can serve the UE location and the
S-NSSAI. Conversely if the AMF detects that an I-SMF is no more needed
(as the service area of the SMF includes the new UE location) it removes
the I-SMF and interfaces directly with the SMF of the PDU Session. If
the AMF detects that the SMF cannot serve the UE location (e.g. due to
mobility), then the AMF selects a new I-SMF serving the UE location. If
the existing I-SMF (or V-SMF) cannot serve the UE location (e.g. due to
mobility) and the service area of the SMF does not include the new UE
location (or the PDU Session is Home Routed), then the AMF initiates an
I-SMF (or V-SMF) change. A V-SMF change may take place either at
intra-PLMN or inter-PLMN mobility.

According to the PCC rules related with AF influence traffic mechanism
regarding DNAI(s), the SMF determines the target DNAI which is
applicable to the current UE location. If current (I-)SMF cannot serve
the target DNAI or if the SMF can server the target DNAI and existing
I-SMF is not needed, the SMF may send the target DNAI information to the
AMF for triggering I-SMF (re)selection or removal, e.g. the AMF performs
I-SMF (re)selection or removal based on the target DNAI and supported
DNAI(s) of (I-)SMF. If the SMF determines that target DNAI currently
served by I-SMF should not be used for the PDU Session hence the
existing I-SMF is not needed (e.g. due to the updated PCC rules removes
DNAI(s) that was provided in the previous PCC rules), the SMF sends the
target DNAI information without including target DNAI to AMF, which may
trigger the I-SMF removal.

At PDU Session Establishment in non-roaming and roaming with LBO
scenarios, if the AMF or SCP cannot select an SMF with a Service Area
supporting the current UE location for the selected (DNN, S-NSSAI) and
required SMF capabilities, the AMF selects an SMF for the selected (DNN,
S-NSSAI) and required capabilities and in addition selects an I-SMF
serving the UE location and the S-NSSAI.

Compared to the SMF selection function defined in clause 6.3.2, the
following parameters are not applicable for I-SMF/V-SMF selection:

\- Data Network Name (DNN).

\- Subscription information from UDM.

NOTE 1: All SMF(s) and I-SMF are assumed to be able to control the UPF
mapping between EPC bearers and 5GC QoS Flows.

If delegated SMF discovery is used at PDU Session establishment:

1\. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to SCP and
includes the parameters as defined in clause 6.3.2 (e.g. the DNN,
required SMF capabilities, UE location) as discovery and selection
parameters. If the SCP successfully selects an SMF matching all
discovery and selection parameters, the SCP forwards the
Nsmf_PDUSessionCreateSMContext Request to the selected SMF.

2\. If the SCP cannot select an SMF matching all discovery and selection
parameters, the SCP returns a dedicated error to AMF. In this case the
I-SMF also need be discovered.

3\. Upon reception of the error from the SCP that an SMF matching all
discovery and selection parameters cannot be found, the AMF performs the
discovery and selection of the SMF from NRF (thus not providing the UE
location as a discovery parameter). The AMF may indicate the maximum
number of SMF instances to be returned from NRF, i.e. SMF selection at
NRF.

4\. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to SCP, which
includes the endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected SMF and the discovery
and selection parameters as defined in clause 6.3.2 except the DNN and
the required SMF capabilities, i.e. parameter for I-SMF selection. The
SCP performs discovery and selection of the I-SMF and forwards the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to the selected I-SMF.

5\. The I-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request towards the SMF
via the SCP; the I-SMF uses the received endpoint (e.g. URI) of the
selected SMF to construct the target destination to be addressed. The
SCP forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the SMF.

6\. The SMF answers to the I-SMF that answers to the AMF; in this answer
the AMF receives the I-SMF ID.

7\. Upon reception of a response from I-SMF, based on the received I-SMF
ID, the AMF may obtain the SMF Service Area of the I-SMF from NRF. The
AMF uses the SMF Service Area of the I-SMF to determine the need for
I-SMF relocation upon subsequent UE mobility.

If delegated I-SMF discovery is used once the PDU Session establishment
has been established, the procedure starts at step 4 above and is
further detailed in the messages flows in clause 23 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

If delegated V-SMF discovery is used for V-SMF reselection, clause 6.3.2
applies, but there is no need for discovery and selection of the H-SMF.
This is further detailed in the messages flows in clause 23 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.34.4 Usage of an UL Classifier for a PDU Session controlled by I-SMF

This clause applies only in the case of non-roaming or LBO roaming as
control of UL CL/BP in VPLMN is not supported in HR case.

When I-SMF is involved for a PDU Session, it is possible that the UL CL
controlled by I-SMF is inserted into the data path of the PDU Session.
The usage of an ULCL controlled by I-SMF in the data path of a PDU
Session is depicted in Figure 5.34.4-1.

![](media/image87.emf)

Figure 5.34.4-1: User plane Architecture for the Uplink Classifier
controlled by I-SMF

The I-SMF determines whether UL CL will be inserted based on information
received from SMF, and the I-SMF selects the UPFs acting as UL CL and/or
PDU Session Anchor providing local access to the Data Network.

### 5.34.5 Usage of IPv6 multi-homing for a PDU Session controlled by I-SMF

This clause applies only in the case of non-roaming or LBO roaming as
control of UL CL/BP in VPLMN is not supported in HR case.

When I-SMF is involved for a PDU Session, it is possible that the BP
controlled by I-SMF is inserted into the data path of the PDU Session.
The usage of a BP controlled by I-SMF in the data path of a PDU Session
is depicted in Figure 5.34.5-1.

![](media/image88.emf)

Figure 5.34.5-1: Multi-homed PDU Session: Branching Point controlled by
I-SMF

The I-SMF determines whether BP will be inserted based on information
received from SMF, and the I-SMF selects the UPFs acting as BP and/or
PDU Session Anchor providing local access to the Data Network.

### 5.34.6 Interaction between I-SMF and SMF for the support of traffic offload by UPF controlled by the I-SMF

#### 5.34.6.1 General

This clause applies only in the case of non-roaming or LBO roaming as
control of UL CL/Branching Point in VPLMN is not supported in HR case.
It applies for the architectures described in clauses 5.34.4 and 5.34.5

When the I-SMF is inserted into a PDU Session, e.g. during PDU Session
establishment or due to UE mobility, the I-SMF may provide the DNAI list
it supports to the SMF. Based on the DNAI list information received from
I-SMF, the SMF may provide the DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session
for local traffic steering to the I-SMF e.g. immediately or when a new
or updated or removed PCC rule(s) is/are received. The DNAI(s) of
interest is derived from PCC rules.

The I-SMF is responsible for the insertion, modification and removal of
UPF(s) to ensure local traffic steering. The SMF does not need to have
access to local configuration or NRF output related with UPF(s)
controlled by I-SMF. Based on the DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU
Session for local traffic steering and UE location the I-SMF determines
which DNAI(s) are to be selected, selects UPF(s) acting as UL CL/BP
and/or PDU Session Anchor based on selected DNAI, and insert these
UPF(s) into the data path of the PDU Session.

When a UL CL/BP has been inserted, changed or removed, the I-SMF
indicates to the SMF that traffic offload have been inserted, updated or
removed for a DNAI, providing also the IPv6 prefix that has been
allocated if a new IPv6 prefix has been allocated for the PDU Session.

From now on the SMF and I-SMF interactions entail:

\- Notifying the SMF with the new Prefix (multi-Homing case): the SMF is
responsible of issuing Router Advertisement message. The SMF constructs
a link-local address as the source IP address. The Router Advertisement
message includes the IPv6 multi-homed routing rules provided to the UE
to select the source IPv6 prefix among the prefixes related with the PDU
Session according to RFC 4191 \[8\]. The SMF sends the Router
Advertisement message to the UE via the PSA UPF controlled by the SMF.

\- N4 interactions related with traffic offloading. The SMF provide N4
information to the I-SMF for how the traffic shall be detected,
enforced, monitored in UPF(s) controlled by the I-SMF: the SMF issues
requests to the I-SMF containing N4 information to be used for creating
/ updating /removing PDR, FAR, QER, URR, etc. The N4 information for
local traffic offload provided by the SMF to the I-SMF are described in
clause 5.34.6.2.

\- Receiving N4 notifications related with traffic usage reporting: the
I-SMF forwards to the SMF N4 information corresponding to UPF
notifications related with traffic usage reporting; the SMF aggregates
and constructs usage reports towards PCF/CHF.

NOTE: How the SMF decides what traffic steering and enforcement actions
are enforced in UPF(s) controlled by I-SMF is left for implementation.

The I-SMF is responsible of the N4 interface towards the local UPF(s)
including:

\- the usage of AN Tunnel Info received from the 5G AN via the AMF in
order to build PDR and FAR;

\- requesting the allocation of the CN Tunnel Info between local UPFs
(if needed);

\- to control UPF actions when the UP of the PDU Session becomes
INACTIVE.

\- provide Trace Requirements on the N4 interface towards the UPF(s) it
is controlling, using Trace Requirements received from AMF.

#### 5.34.6.2 N4 information sent from SMF to I-SMF for local traffic offload

The SMF generates N4 information for local traffic offload based on the
available DNAI(s) indicated by the I-SMF, PCC rules associated with
these DNAI(s) and charging requirement. This N4 information is sent from
the SMF to the I-SMF after UL CL/Branching Point
insertion/update/removal, and the I-SMF uses this N4 information to
derive rules installed in the UPFs controlled by the I-SMF.

The N4 information for local traffic offload corresponds to rules and
parameters defined in clause 5.8.2.11, i.e. PDR, FAR, URR and QER. It
contains identifiers allowing the SMF to later modify or delete these
rules.

N4 information for local traffic offload is generated by the SMF without
knowledge of how many local UPF(s) are actually used by the I-SMF. The
SMF indicates whether a rule within N4 information is enforced in UL CL/
Branching Point or local PSA. If the rule is applied to the local PSA,
the N4 information includes the associated DNAI. The I-SMF generates
suitable rules for the UPF(s) based on the N4 information received from
SMF.

NOTE: The SMF is not aware of whether there is a single PSA or multiple
PSA controlled by I-SMF.

The following parameters are managed by the I-SMF:

\- The 5G AN Tunnel Info.

\- CN tunnel info between local UPFs.

\- Network instance (if needed).

The N4 information exchanged between I-SMF and SMF are not associated
with a N4 Session ID but are associated with an N16a association
allowing the SMF to modify or delete the N4 information at a later
stage.

The I-SMF generates an N4 Session ID and for each rule a Rule ID (unless
the ones received from the SMF can be used) and maintains a mapping
between the locally generated identifiers and the ones received from the
SMF. The I-SMF replaces those IDs in the PDR(s), QER(s), URR(s) and
FAR(s) received from the SMF. When the I-SMF receives the N4
information, the Network instance (if needed) included in the rules sent
to the UPF is generated by I-SMF.

### 5.34.7 Event Management

#### 5.34.7.1 UE\'s Mobility Event Management

When an I-SMF is involved in a PDU Session, the SMF and I-SMF
independently subscribe to \"UE mobility event notification\" service
provided by AMF. The AMF treats the SMF\'s and I-SMF\'s subscription
separately and notifies the event directly to the SMF or I-SMF. If the
SMF does not know the serving AMF address, the SMF gets the serving AMF
address from the UDM as described in clause 5.2.3.2.4, TS 23.502 \[3\]
and subscribes directly with the serving AMF.

In the case of AMF change (e.g. Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover),
the target AMF receives mobility event subscription information from the
source AMF and updates the mobility event subscription information with
the SMF and I-SMF independently (i.e. target AMF allocates the
Subscription Correlation ID for each event and notifies the respective
SMFs and I-SMF as described in clause 5.3.4.4).

In the case of I-SMF change or I-SMF insertion (e.g. at Inter NG-RAN
node N2 based handover), the subscription of mobility event (from AMF)
is not transferred from the old I-SMF or SMF to the new I-SMF, the new
I-SMF triggers a new subscription event if the new I-SMF wants to
receive the corresponding mobility event. In the case of I-SMF removal,
the subscription of mobility event at the AMF is not transferred from
the old I-SMF to the SMF, the SMF triggers a new subscription event if
the SMF wants to receive the corresponding mobility event.

The subscription from the old SMF entity (old I-SMF, SMF) is removed via
an explicitly request from this old SMF entity.

#### 5.34.7.2 SMF event exposure service

Consumers of SMF events do not need to be aware of the insertion /
removal / change of an I-SMF as they always subscribe to the SMF of the
PDU Session.

Except for the events documented in the present clause, the I-SMF does
not need to support the events defined in clause 5.2.8.3.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

For Events \"First downlink packet per source of the downlink IP traffic
(buffered / discarded / transmitted)\", when an I-SMF is involved in the
PDU Session, the SMF subscribes / unsubscribes onto I-SMF for the PDU
Session ID on behalf of the event consumer (e.g. at I-SMF insertion or
when a consumer subscribes or un subscribes while an I-SMF serves the
PDU Session) and the I-SMF directly notifies the event consumer. At
I-SMF change, the related SMF event subscriptions are not transferred
from source I-SMF to the target I-SMF. The SMF may trigger new
subscription event to the target I-SMF if the SMF wants to receive the
corresponding SMF event. At I-SMF change or removal the corresponding
subscription is removed in the source I-SMF when it removes the context
associated with the PDU Session Id.

#### 5.34.7.3 AMF implicit subscription about events related with the PDU Session

When creating an association with a SMF or I-SMF for a PDU Session, the
AMF implicitly subscribes to SMF / I-SMF about events related with the
PDU Session (the AMF provides the relevant notification information to
the SMF or the I-SMF respectively). This implicit subscription is
implicitly released when the corresponding association with the SMF /
I-SMF is removed (e.g. as no more needed due to a I-SMF insertion /
change / removal).

### 5.34.8 Support for Cellular IoT

This clause defines the specific impacts of deployments topologies with
specific SMF Service Areas on how 5GS supports Cellular IoT as defined
in clause 5.31.

For a PDU Session supporting Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as
defined in clause 5.31.4:

\- For a PDU session towards a DNN/S-NSSAI for which the subscription
includes a NEF Identity for NIDD (i.e. for a PDU session which will be
anchored in NEF), the AMF never inserts an I-SMF.

When an I-SMF is inserted to serve a PDU Session, the I-SMF supports the
features that, as specified in clause 5.31, apply to the V-SMF in the
case of Home Routed.

NOTE: This can require the SMF to subscribe onto I-SMF about RAT type
change for a PDU Session as described in clause 4.23 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.34.9 Support of the Deployment Topologies with specific SMF Service Areas feature within and between PLMN(s)

When Deployments Topologies with specific SMF Service Areas need to be
used in a PLMN for a S-NSSAI, all AMF serving this S-NSSAI are
configured to support Deployments Topologies with specific SMF Service
Areas.

NOTE 1: The specifications do not support AMF selection related with
Deployment Topologies with specific SMF Service Areas.

For HR roaming, the AMF discovers at PDU Session establishment whether a
H-SMF supports V-SMF change based on feature support indication received
from the NRF, possibly via the SCP. When the V-PLMN requires Deployments
Topologies with specific SMF Service Areas but no H-SMF can be selected
that supports V-SMF change, a H-SMF not supporting V-SMF change may be
selected by the VPLMN. In that case, and if a V-SMF serving the full
VPLMN is available, AMF should prefer to select such V-SMF.

In this release of the specifications, when an AMF detects the need to
change the V-SMF while the H-SMF does not support V-SMF change, the AMF
shall not trigger V-SMF change but shall trigger the release of the PDU
Session.

NOTE 2: The AMF can determine whether the H-SMF supports V-SMF change
based on NRF look up.

### 5.34.10 Support for 5G LAN-type service

This clause defines how 5GS supports 5G LAN-type service as defined in
clause 5.29 in the case of deployments topologies with specific SMF
Service Areas.

The UE may be connected with the PSA via an I-UPF which is controlled by
the I-SMF. In this case, traffic switching (e.g. UPF local traffic
switching) is controlled by the SMF as described in clause 5.29.4
without any specific knowledge or involvement of the I-SMF to support
the 5G LAN-type service.

## 5.35 Support for Integrated access and backhaul (IAB)

### 5.35.1 IAB architecture and functional entities

Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) enables wireless in-band and
out-of-band relaying of NR Uu access traffic via NR Uu backhaul links.
In this Release of the specification, NR satellite access is not
applicable. The serving PLMN may provide the mobility restriction for NR
satellite access as specified in clause 5.3.4.1

The Uu backhaul links can exist between the IAB-node and:

\- a gNB referred to as IAB-donor; or

\- another IAB-node.

The part of the IAB node that supports the Uu interface towards the
IAB-donor or another parent IAB-node (and thus manages the backhaul
connectivity with either PLMN or SNPN it is registered with) is referred
to as an IAB-UE.

In this Release of the specification, the IAB-UE function does not apply
to the NR RedCap UE.

At high level, IAB has the following characteristics:

\- IAB uses the CU/DU architecture defined in TS 38.401 \[42\], and the
IAB operation via F1 (between IAB-donor and IAB-node) is invisible to
the 5GC;

\- IAB performs relaying at layer-2, and therefore does not require a
local UPF;

\- IAB supports multi-hop backhauling;

\- IAB supports dynamic topology update, i.e. the IAB-node can change
the parent node, e.g. another IAB-node, or the IAB-donor, during
operation, for example in response to backhaul link failure or blockage.

Figure 5.35.1-1 shows the IAB reference architecture with two backhaul
hops, when connected to 5GC.

![](media/image89.emf)

Figure 5.35.1-1: IAB architecture for 5GS

The gNB-DU in the IAB-node is responsible for providing NR Uu access to
UEs and child IAB-nodes. The corresponding gNB-CU function resides on
the IAB-donor gNB, which controls IAB-node gNB-DU via the F1 interface.
IAB-node appears as a normal gNB to UEs and other IAB-nodes and allows
them to connect to the 5GC.

The IAB-UE function behaves as a UE, and reuses UE procedures to connect
to:

\- the gNB-DU on a parent IAB-node or IAB-donor for access and
backhauling;

\- the gNB-CU on the IAB-donor via RRC for control of the access and
backhaul link;

\- 5GC, e.g. AMF, via NAS;

\- OAM system via a PDU session or PDN connection (based on
implementation).

NOTE: The 5GC, e.g. SMF, may detect that a PDU session for the IAB-UE is
for the OAM system access, e.g. by checking the DNN and/or
configuration. It is up to the operator configuration to choose whether
to use 1 or multiple QoS Flows for OAM traffic and the appropriate QoS
parameters, e.g. using 5QI=6 for software downloading, and 5QI=80 with
signalled higher priority or a pre-configured 5QI for alarm or control
traffic.

The IAB-UE can connect to 5GC over NR (SA mode) or connect to EPC (EN-DC
mode). The UE served by the IAB-node can operate in the same or
different modes than the IAB-node as defined in TS 38.401 \[42\]. The
operation mode with both UE and IAB-node connected to EPC is covered in
TS 23.401 \[26\]. Operation modes with UE and IAB-node connected to
different core networks are described in clause 5.35.6.

### 5.35.2 5G System enhancements to support IAB

In IAB operation, the IAB-UE interacts with the 5GC using procedures
defined for UE. The IAB-node gNB-DU only interacts with the IAB-donor-CU
and follows the CU/DU design defined in TS 38.401 \[42\].

For the IAB-UE operation, the existing UE authentication methods as
defined in TS 33.501 \[29\] applies. Both USIM based methods and EAP
based methods are allowed, and NAI based SUPIs can be used.

The following aspects are enhanced to support the IAB operation:

\- the Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] is enhanced to indicate IAB-node\'s capability to the
AMF;

\- The IAB-node provides an IAB-indication to the IAB-donor-CU when the
RRC connection is established as defined in TS 38.331 \[28\]. When the
IAB-indication is received, the IAB-donor-CU selects an AMF that
supports IAB and includes the IAB-indication in the N2 INITIAL UE
MESSAGE as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\] so that the AMF can perform IAB
authorization.

\- the UE Subscription data as defined in clause 5.2.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] is enhanced to include the authorization information for
the IAB operation;

\- Authorization procedure during the UE Registration procedure is
enhanced to perform verification of IAB subscription information;

\- UE Context setup/modification procedure is enhanced to provide IAB
authorized indication to NG-RAN.

After registered to the 5G system, the IAB-node remains in CM-CONNECTED
state. In the case of radio link failure, the IAB-UE uses existing UE
procedure to restore the connection with the network. The IAB-UE uses
Deregistration Procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]
to disconnect from the network.

### 5.35.3 Data handling and QoS support with IAB

Control plane and user plane protocol stacks for IAB operation are
defined in TS 38.300 \[27\].

QoS management for IAB can remain transparent to the 5GC. If NG-RAN
cannot meet a QoS requirement for a QoS Flow to IAB-related resource
constraints, the NG-RAN can reject the request using procedures defined
in TS 23.502 \[3\].

The IAB-UE function can establish a PDU session or PDN connection, e.g.
for OAM purpose (protocol stack not shown here). In that case, the
IAB-UE obtains an IP address/prefix from the core network using normal
UE procedures. The IAB-UE\'s IP address is different from that of the
IAB-node\'s gNB DU IP address.

NOTE: For OAM traffic, based on their specific requirements, operators
can select QoS characteristics and reference them by operator specific
5QI(s) or using signalled QoS characteristics within the operator\'s
network.

### 5.35.4 Mobility support with IAB

For UEs, all existing NR intra-RAT mobility and dual-connectivity
procedures are supported when the UE is served by an IAB-node except for
the cases of NR satellite access. However, in this release of the
specification, there is no system level support of service continuity
for a UE served by an IAB-node when the serving IAB-node changes its
IAB-donor-CU.

### 5.35.5 Charging support with IAB

IAB-donor has all the information regarding the UE and the IAB-node and
corresponding mapping of the bearers. The PDU sessions for the UE and
IAB-node are separate from IAB-node onwards to the core network.
Therefore, the existing charging mechanism as defined in clause 5.12 can
be used to support IAB.

### 5.35.6 IAB operation involving EPC

When the IAB-donor gNB has connection to both EPC and 5GC, based on PLMN
configuration, there are two possible operation modes:

\- the IAB-node connects to a 5GC via the IAB-donor gNB, while the UEs
served by the IAB-node connect to EPC with Dual Connectivity as defined
in TS 37.340 \[31\]. In this operation mode, the IAB-donor gNB has
connection to an eNB, and the 5GC is restricted for IAB-node access
only; and

\- the IAB-node connects to an EPC via the IAB-donor gNB with Dual
Connectivity as defined in TS 37.340 \[31\], while the UEs served by the
IAB-node connect to the 5GC. In this operation mode, the EPC is
restricted for IAB-node access only.

To support the above operation modes, the IAB-UE shall be configured to
select only a specific PLMN (as defined in TS 23.122 \[17\]) and whether
it needs to connect to 5GC or EPC.

NOTE: For a particular PLMN, it is expected that only one of the modes
would be deployed in a known region.

## 5.36 RIM Information Transfer

The purpose of RIM Information Transfer is to enable the transfer of RIM
information between two RAN nodes via 5GC. The RIM Information Transfer
is specified in TS 38.413 \[34\].

When the source AMF receives RIM information from source NG-RAN towards
target NG-RAN, the source AMF forwards the RIM information to the target
AMF, as described in TS 38.413 \[34\] and TS 29.518 \[71\]. The AMF does
not interpret the transferred RIM information.

## 5.37 Support for high data rate low latency services

Interactive services that require high data rate and low latency
communication, e.g. cloud gaming and AR/VR services are documented in
TS 22.261 \[2\]. Standardized 5QI characteristics for such services are
provided in Table 5.7.4-1 and TSCAI can be used to describe the related
traffic characteristics as defined in clause 5.27.2.

## 5.38 Support for Multi-USIM UE

### 5.38.1 General

A network and a Multi-USIM UE may support one or more of the following
features for Multi-USIM UE operation:

\- Connection Release as described in clause 5.38.2;

\- Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service, as described in
clause 5.38.3;

\- Reject Paging Request, as described in clause 5.38.4;

\- Paging Restriction, as described in clause 5.38.5;

\- Paging Timing Collision Control, as described in clause 5.38.6.

In the Registration procedure (as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2), when a
Multi-USIM UE has more than one USIM active, supports and intends to use
one or more Multi-USIM specific features, it indicates to the AMF the
corresponding Multi-USIM feature(s) are supported (except for the Paging
Timing Collision Control feature). Based on the received indication of
the supported Multi-USIM features from the UE, the AMF shall indicate to
the UE the support of the Multi-USIM features based on the Multi-USIM
features supported by network and any preference policy by the network,
if available. When a UE returns to having only one USIM active from a
Multi-USIM UE that previously indicated to the network it supported
Multi-USIM feature(s), the UE shall indicate all the Multi-USIM features
are not supported to the network for that USIM. The AMF shall only
indicate the support of Paging Restriction feature together with the
support of either Connection Release feature or Reject Paging Request
feature.

The Multi-USIM UE includes the support of individual features for
Connection Release, Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service, Reject
Paging Request and Paging Restriction as specified in clause 5.4.4a.

NOTE: The Paging Timing Collision Control feature being based on the
Mobility Registration Update, and it doesn\'t require capability
exchange between the UE and network.

The network shall not indicate support for any Multi-USIM feature to the
UE as part of the Emergency Registration procedure.

A Multi-USIM UE shall use a separate PEI for each USIM when it registers
with the network.

### 5.38.2 Connection Release

A Multi-USIM UE may request the network to release the UE from
RRC-CONNECTED state in 3GPP access for a USIM due to activity on another
USIM in 3GPP access, if both UE and network indicate the Connection
Release feature is supported to each other.

In the case of NAS connection release procedure, the UE indicates that
it requests to be released from RRC-CONNECTED state, by initiating
either a Service Request procedure over 3GPP access or a Registration
procedure over 3GPP access (if case the UE needs to perform Registration
Update at the same time with this network, including the case where the
Registration Request is sent due to mobility outside the Registration
Area, i.e. before detecting whether the network supports the feature in
the new Tracking Area, provided that the network has already indicated
support for Connection Release feature in the current stored
Registration Area), by including a Release Request Indication. If
supported by the UE and network, the UE may also provide, only together
with the Release Request Indication, Paging Restriction Information, as
specified in clause 5.38.5, which requests the network to restrict
paging. If the UE is performing an Emergency Registration then it shall
not include a Release Request Indication.

For NR/5G access, an AS method for the UE to request the network to
release the UE from RRC-CONNECTED state is specified in
TS 38.300 \[27\]. This mechanism does not allow the UE to indicate
Paging Restrictions.

NOTE 1: When both the access stratum and NAS based approaches for
requesting the connection release are supported by the UE and the
network, it depends on the UE implementation which of the two to use
(for example: based on the preferred end state (RRC-INACTIVE or IDLE)
and whether Paging Restriction Information is to be provided).

NOTE 2: When there is no PLMN-wide support for the Connection Release
feature, it can occur that upon Mobility Registration Update with
Release Request indication the UE is not released by the network. The UE
behaviour, when it detects that the network does not support the feature
in a new RA, is outside the scope of this specification.

### 5.38.3 Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service

A Multi-USIM UE and the network may support Paging Cause Indication for
Voice Service feature.

The network that supports Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service
feature shall provide a Voice Service Indication for IMS voice service
in the Paging message, only if the UE indicates the Paging Cause
Indication for Voice Service feature is supported to the network. The
network determines the IMS voice service based on the Paging Policy
Indicator as specified in clause 5.4.3.2.

Upon reception of the Voice Service Indication in NGAP Paging Message
from AMF, the NG-RAN supporting Paging Cause Indication for Voice
Service should include the Voice Service Indication in the Uu Paging
message to the UE.

When the UE context in the AMF indicates Paging Cause Indication for
Voice Service feature is supported, in order to require NG RAN to
deliver the Voice Service Indication in RAN paging for the UE in
RRC-Inactive state, the AMF provides an indication indicating the Paging
Cause Indication for Voice Service feature is supported to the NG-RAN.
Upon reception of the indication, the NG-RAN that supports the feature
stores a Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service indication in its the
UE context. For a UE in RRC-Inactive, the NG-RAN should provide the
Voice Service Indication in the RAN Paging message only when there is
Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service indication in the UE context
and detects the downlink data which triggers the RAN Paging message is
related to voice service based on the Paging Policy Indicator, in the
header of the received downlink data, as specified in clause 5.4.3.2.

UE that supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature
is capable of differentiation between Paging from a network that does
not support the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature and
Paging without the Voice Service Indication. How the UE distinguishes
the Paging from a RAN that does not support the Paging Cause Indication
for Voice Service feature and Paging without the Voice Service
Indication is defined in TS 38.331 \[28\]. The UE determines whether the
Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature is supported in the
current Registration Area by 5GC based on the MUSIM capability exchange
with the AMF, see clause 5.38.1. The UE determines that the Paging Cause
Indication for Voice Service feature is supported if it is supported by
both the RAN, as indicated in the received Uu Paging message, and by
5GC, as indicated in the MUSIM capability exchange with the AMF.

The UE uses the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service as described
in TS 24.501 \[47\] and TS 38.331 \[28\].

### 5.38.4 Reject Paging Request

A Multi-USIM UE may set up a connection to respond to a page with a
Reject Paging Indication to the network indicating that the UE does not
accept the paging and requests to return to CM-IDLE state after sending
this response, if both UE and network indicate the Reject Paging Request
feature is supported to each other.

Upon being paged by the network, the Multi-USIM UE in CM-IDLE state
attempts to send a Service Request message to the paging network
including the Reject Paging Indication as the response to the paging,
unless it is unable to do so, e.g. due to UE implementation constraints.
In addition to the Reject Paging Indication, the UE may include Paging
Restriction Information as specified in clause 5.38.5 in the Service
Request message, if supported by UE and network.

NOTE: A Multi-USIM UE in RRC_INACTIVE state can decide to not initiate
the RRC connection resumption procedure, e.g. when it decides not to
respond to the paging message due to UE implementation constraints as
specified in TS 24.501 \[47\] and TS 38.331 \[28\].

### 5.38.5 Paging Restriction

A Multi-USIM UE and the network may support Paging Restriction. A
Multi-USIM UE, if the AMF indicates that the network supports Paging
Restriction feature, may indicate Paging Restriction Information in the
Service Request or Registration Request message (including the case
where the Registration Request is sent due to mobility outside the
Registration Area, i.e. before detecting whether the network supports
the feature in the new Tracking Area, provided that the network has
already indicated support for Paging Restriction feature in the current
stored Registration Area) as specified in clauses 5.38.2 and 5.38.4.

Based on operator policy the AMF may accept or reject the Paging
Restriction Information requested by the UE. If the AMF accepts the
Paging Restriction Information from the UE, the AMF stores the Paging
Restriction Information from the UE in the UE context. If the AMF
rejects the Paging Restriction Information, the AMF removes any stored
Paging Restriction Information from the UE context and discards the UEs
requested Paging Restriction Information. The AMF informs the UE about
the acceptance/rejection of the requested Paging Restriction Information
in the Registration Accept or Service Accept message.

If the UE does not provide any Paging Restriction Information in the
Service Request over 3GPP access or the Registration Request over 3GPP
access, the AMF removes any stored Paging Restriction Information from
the UE context.

The Paging Restriction Information may indicate any of the following:

a\) all paging is restricted; or

b\) all paging is restricted, except paging for voice service (IMS
voice); or

c\) all paging is restricted, except for certain PDU Session(s); or

d\) all paging is restricted, except paging for voice service (IMS
voice) and certain PDU session(s).

NOTE 1: The UE expects not to be paged for any purpose in case a). The
UE expects to be paged only for voice service in case b). The UE expects
to be paged only for certain PDU Session(s) in case c). The UE expects
to be paged for voice service and certain PDU session(s) in case d). The
AMF can page the UE for mobile terminated signalling based on local
policy considering the stored Paging Restriction Information, except for
case a). In this case, to comply with the UE provided Paging Restriction
Information, the AMF can trigger AN release procedure as soon as
possible after the mobile terminated signalling procedure is executed.

NOTE 2: In the case of roaming, the Paging Restrictions for voice
service implied by bullet b) and d) depends on the existence of an
agreement with the HPLMN to support voice service via IMS. Hence the
support of Paging Restrictions in bullets b) and d) takes the IMS voice
service agreement into consideration.

NOTE 3: When there is no PLMN-wide support for the Paging Restriction
feature, it can occur that upon Mobility Registration Update with Paging
Restriction Information the UE detects the network does not support the
feature. If so, the UE assumes that no Paging Restriction Information is
applied.

### 5.38.6 Paging Timing Collision Control

To avoid possible paging occasion collision and to enhance the
likelihood that paging is received successfully for different USIMs, a
Multi-USIM UE may need a new 5G-GUTI to modify the timing of the Paging
Occasions (POs) for a USIM when the USIM\'s registration is not
emergency registration. When a Multi-USIM UE needs a 5G-GUTI assignment,
it performs a Mobility Registration Update without any specific
indication (i.e. it is using a normal Registration procedure). This
triggers the AMF to allocate a new 5G-GUTI and provide it to the
Multi-USIM UE in the Registration Accept message.

NOTE: It is recommended to avoid excessive signalling load from UE due
to this procedure.

## 5.39 Remote provisioning of credentials for NSSAA or secondary authentication/authorization

### 5.39.1 General

The UE\'s subscribed network (i.e. HPLMN, or subscribed SNPN) may
provide functionalities to provision or update the credentials used for
NSSAA or credentials used for secondary authentication/authorization to
the UE. The provisioning procedure is supported via User Plane.

For User Plane Remote Provisioning, the UE establishes a PDU Session
that is used for remote provisioning, e.g. by using DNN(s)/S-NSSAI(s)
which can access the PVS. The AMF selects an SMF used for remote
provisioning using the SMF discovery and selection functionality as
described in clause 6.3.2. If the SMF is configured with the PVS
address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s), the SMF shall send the PVS address(es)
and/or PVS FQDN(s) per DNN/S-NSSAI to the UE via PCO during PDU Session
Establishment procedure, based on the UE\'s subscribed DNN(s)/S-NSSAI(s)
and the UE\'s request of PVS information from the network.
Alternatively, the UE may be configured with an address of a PVS or the
PVS may subscribe for UE Reachability Notification and may use the
Application Triggering procedure as specified in TS 23.502 \[3\] to
trigger the UE to initiate the setup of a connection for remote
provisioning.

### 5.39.2 Configuration for the UE

In order to enable UP Remote Provisioning of credentials for NSSAA or
secondary authentication/authorization, UE Configuration Data for UP
Remote Provisioning are either pre-configured on the UE or provided by
the network to the UE. UE Configuration Data for UP Remote Provisioning
provided by the network take precedence over corresponding configuration
data stored in the UE.

UE Configuration Data for UP Remote Provisioning consist of PVS IP
address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s). The PVS IP address or PVS FQDN may be
associated with dedicated DNN(s) and/or S-NSSAI(s).

If the UE does not have any PVS IP address or PVS FQDN after the
establishment of a PDU Session used for UP remote provisioning, the UE
may construct an FQDN for PVS discovery as defined in TS 23.003 \[19\].

The UE Configuration Data for UP Remote Provisioning may be stored in
the ME.

The UE Configuration Data for UP Remote Provisioning (i.e. PVS IP
address(es) or PVS FQDN(s)) associated with dedicated DNN(s) and/or
S-NSSAI(s) may be locally configured in the SMF. The UE Configuration
Data for UP Remote Provisioning, if available, shall be provided to the
UE during the establishment of any PDU Session used for UP Remote
Provisioning as part of Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) in the PDU
Session Establishment Response, if the UE has requested the PVS
information via PCO in the PDU Session Establishment Request.

## 5.40 Support of Disaster Roaming with Minimization of Service Interruption

### 5.40.1 General

Subject to operator policy and national/regional regulations, 5GS
provides Disaster Roaming service (e.g. voice call and data service) for
the UEs from PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition. The UE shall attempt
Disaster Roaming only if:

\- there is no available PLMN which is allowable (see TS 23.122 \[17\]);

\- the UE is not in RM-REGISTERED and CM-CONNECTED state over non-3GPP
access connected to 5GCN;

\- the UE cannot get service over non-3GPP access through ePDG;

\- the UE supports Disaster Roaming service;

\- the UE has been configured by the HPLMN with an indication of whether
Disaster roaming is enabled in the UE set to \"disaster roaming is
enabled in the UE\" as specified in clause 5.40.2; and

\- a PLMN without Disaster Condition is able to accept Disaster Inbound
Roamers from the PLMN with Disaster Condition.

In this Release of the specification, the Disaster Condition only
applies to NG-RAN nodes, which means the rest of the network functions
except one or more NG-RAN nodes of the PLMN with Disaster Condition can
be assumed to be operational.

### 5.40.2 UE configuration and provisioning for Disaster Roaming

A UE supporting Disaster Roaming is configured with the following
information:

\- Optionally, indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the
UE;

\- Optionally, indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be
used in disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\';

\- Optionally, list of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition.

The Activation of Disaster Roaming is performed by the HPLMN by setting
the indication of whether Disaster roaming is enabled in the UE to
\"disaster roaming is enabled in the UE\" using the UE Parameters Update
Procedure as defined in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The UE shall only perform
disaster roaming if the HPLMN has configured the UE with the indication
of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE and set the indication
to \"disaster roaming is enabled in the UE\". The UE, registered for
Disaster Roaming service, shall deregister from the PLMN providing
Disaster Roaming service if the received indication of whether disaster
roaming is enabled in the UE is set to \"disaster roaming is disabled in
the UE\".

The optional \'list of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition\' may be
pre-configured in USIM or provided by the HPLMN during and after a
successful registration procedure over 3GPP access or non-3GPP access
via Registration Request procedure or UE Configuration Update procedure
as defined in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The \'list of PLMN(s) to be used in
Disaster Condition\' may be configured over non-3GPP access before
disaster condition has occurred.

While roaming (i.e. not in HPLMN), the Registered PLMN may provide the
\'list of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition\' during and after a
successful registration procedure to the UE via Registration Request
procedure or UE Configuration Update procedure as specified in
TS 23.502 \[3\]. This list shall not alter any list provided by the
HPLMN and shall only be used if the UE is configured by the HPLMN using
the UE Parameters Update Procedure as defined in TS 23.502 \[3\] with
the indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in
disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' set to \"True\".

The details of the UE behaviour regarding the usage of this list are
described in TS 23.122 \[17\] and TS 24.501 \[47\]. If the UE is not
configured with \'list of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition\',
the UE follows the procedure described in TS 23.122 \[17\] to select
PLMN to be used in Disaster Condition.

The HPLMN may use UE Parameters Update Procedure as defined in
TS 23.502 \[3\] to update the Disaster Roaming information configuration
in UE, if the UDM has received MINT support indication as indicated in
5GMM capability from the AMF. The UE indicates the support of MINT in
5GMM capability as specified in clause 5.4.4a, during registration
procedure as defined in TS 23.502 \[3\].

### 5.40.3 Disaster Condition Notification and Determination

The NG-RAN in the PLMN that provides Disaster Roaming service,
broadcasts an indication of accessibility for Disaster Roaming service,
and optionally, a \'list of one or more PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition
for which Disaster Roaming service is offered by the available PLMN\' in
the impacted area as described in TS 38.304 \[50\] and TS 38.331 \[28\].

A UE determines the Disaster Condition based on the information
broadcasted from the NG-RAN providing Disaster Roaming service, and
performs the network selection and the access control for the Disaster
Roaming as described in TS 23.122 \[17\] and TS 24.501 \[47\].

NOTE 1: How a PLMN is notified that another PLMN is a PLMN with Disaster
Condition and how a PLMN is notified of the area where the associated
Disaster Condition applies is managed by the government agencies or the
authorities, and is out of scope of 3GPP.

NOTE 2: The broadcast for Disaster Roaming service from the NG-RAN
occurs only during the Disaster Condition.

### 5.40.4 Registration for Disaster Roaming service

For a UE to receive Disaster Roaming service from a PLMN providing
Disaster Roaming service, the UE sends a NAS Registration Request
message with Registration Type value \"Disaster Roaming Initial
Registration\" or \"Disaster Roaming Mobility Registration Update\":

\- When the AMF in the PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service receives
a NAS Registration Request with Registration Type set to \"Disaster
Roaming Initial Registration\" or \"Disaster Roaming Mobility
Registration Update\";

\- the AMF controls if the UE is allowed to access Disaster Roaming
service in the area with Disaster Condition as specified in
clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\];

\- the AMF may provide the Disaster Roaming service indication to AUSF
and UDM as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] and
TS 33.501 \[29\]. The AMF may provide the Disaster Roaming service
indication to SMF as specified in clause 4.3.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 1: The AUSF and the UDM are configured with Disaster Condition via
OAM based on operator policy and the request by the government agencies.
Based on this local configuration and/or the Disaster Roaming service
indication, the AUSF can execute authentication of the UE, and the UDM
can provides the subscription data for a Disaster Roaming service to the
AMF and/or the SMF.

To support the Disaster Roaming service, the PLMN providing Disaster
Roaming service is configured to support communication with the network
entities in the HPLMN of the UE, i.e. configurations related to roaming
interfaces for communication between serving PLMN and HPLMN shall be
deployed in the affected entities. This communication between the PLMNs
need only be enabled during the Disaster Condition.

The Disaster Roaming service is limited to the impacted geographic area
with Disaster Condition. The NG-RAN nodes and AMF in the PLMN providing
Disaster Roaming service are configured with the area information, i.e.
a list of TAIs which can be formulated by the PLMN providing the
Disaster Roaming service based on the geographic area with Disaster
Condition in the other PLMN(s).

The AMF in the PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service provides the
mobility restriction list to the NG-RAN as specified in clause 5.3.4.1.1
considering the area with Disaster Condition, and also indicating that
EPC is not an allowed core network.

NOTE 2: From the perspective of emergency services, a UE is following
procedures as described in clause 4.24 of TS 24.501 \[47\] when
registered for Disaster Roaming service.

### 5.40.5 Handling when a Disaster Condition is no longer applicable

When a UE detects a Disaster Condition is no longer applicable, the UE
performs PLMN selection as described in TS 23.122 \[17\] and
TS 24.501 \[47\] and may return to the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition.

A PLMN providing Disaster Roaming:

\- May trigger the Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs to return to the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition when the Disaster Inbound Roamers
attempt to transit to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.

\- May trigger the Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs to return to the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition by triggering Deregistration
procedure.

\- May trigger the Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs to return to the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition by rejecting Registration Request
message.

\- May trigger the Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs to return to the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition by rejecting Service Request message.

\- Shall organise the return of the Disaster Roaming UEs in a manner
that does not cause overload (e.g. of signalling) in the PLMN that
previously had the Disaster Condition.

\- Stop broadcasting of providing Disaster Roaming service as specified
in clause 5.40.3.

\- May determine that the disaster condition has ended and the UE which
is registered for disaster roaming services has an emergency PDU
session, the AMF initiates the UE configuration update procedure to
indicate that the UE is registered for emergency services as described
in TS 24.501 \[47\].

\- May determine that the disaster condition has ended and inform the UE
by initiating the UE configuration update procedure indicating
re-registration from UE is required as specified in clause 5.4.4 of
TS 24.501 \[47\] if the UE is in CM-CONNECTED mode.

NOTE: Whether and how long the PLMN waits before paging the Disaster
Inbound Roamers upon being notified that a Disaster Condition no longer
applies is up to operator\'s policy.

The HPLMN i.e. the UDM may trigger the Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs to
return to the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition by triggering
Deregistration procedure.

### 5.40.6 Prevention of signalling overload related to Disaster Condition and Disaster Roaming service

The load control, congestion and overload control mechanism specified in
clause 5.19 and access control and barring specified in clause 5.2.5 can
be used to mitigate the load caused by UE requesting the Disaster
Roaming service in the PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service and
returning of UE to allowable PLMN when Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable.

To prevent signalling overload in PLMN providing Disaster Roaming, the
HPLMN or registered PLMN:

\- may provide the UE in a prioritized manner with the list of PLMNs
described in clause 5.40.2 for Disaster Roaming;

\- may provide disaster roaming wait range information to control when
the UE can initiate the registration for Disaster Roaming service upon
arriving in the PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service as specified in
TS 23.122 \[17\] and TS 24.501 \[47\]; and

\- applies Access Identity 3 for Disaster Roaming service request as
specified in TS 24.501 \[47\].

NOTE: The mechanisms available at the AMF and the SMF for mitigation of
overload and congestion are used for 5GSM congestion mitigation during
the Disaster Roaming.

To prevent signalling overload by returning UEs in PLMN previously with
Disaster Condition which is no long applicable, the HPLMN or registered
PLMN:

\- may provide disaster return wait range information to control when
the UE can initiate the registration upon returning to the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\] and
TS 24.501 \[47\].

## 5.41 NR RedCap UEs differentiation

This functionality is used by the network to identify traffic to/from
UEs accessing over NR RedCap, e.g. for charging differentiation.

An NR RedCap UE using NR shall provide an NR RedCap indication to the
NG-RAN during RRC Connection Establishment procedure as defined in
TS 38.331 \[28\].

When the UE has provided an NR RedCap indication to the NG-RAN during
RRC Connection Establishment, the NG-RAN shall provide an NR RedCap
Indication to the AMF in the Initial UE Message (see clause 4.2.2.2.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\] and TS 38.413 \[34\]).

When the AMF receives an NR RedCap Indication from NG-RAN in an Initial
UE Message, the AMF shall store the NR RedCap Indication in the UE
context, consider that the RAT type is NR RedCap and signal it
accordingly to the SMSF during registration procedure for SMS over NAS,
to the SMF during PDU Session Establishment or PDU Session Modification
procedure. The PCF will also receive the NR RedCap RAT type indication
when applicable, from the SMF during SM Policy Association Establishment
or SM Policy Association Modification procedure.

During handover from E-UTRA to NR, the target NG-RAN (i.e. gNB) provides
the NR RedCap indication to AMF in NGAP Path Switch Request message
during Xn handover, or NGAP Handover Request Acknowledge message during
N2 handover (including intra 5GS N2 handover and EPS to 5GS handover)
based on the UE capability information provided by the source RAN to the
target RAN as specified in TS 38.300 \[27\].

The NFs interacting with CHF shall include the NR RedCap as RAT type.

Upon AMF change, the source AMF shall provide the \"NR RedCap
Indication\" to the target AMF.

## 5.42 Support of Non-seamless WLAN offload

Non-seamless WLAN offload is an optional capability of a UE supporting
WLAN radio access.

The architecture to support authentication for Non-seamless WLAN offload
in 5GS is defined in clause 4.2.15.

A UE supporting Non-seamless WLAN offload may, while connected to WLAN
access, route specific data flows via the WLAN access without traversing
the 5GC. These UE data flows are identified using URSP configuration for
Non-Seamless Offload, or UE Local Configurations as defined in
TS 23.503 \[45\]. For these data flows, the UE uses the local IP address
allocated by the WLAN access network and no IP address preservation is
provided between WLAN and NG-RAN.

For performing the Non-seamless WLAN offload, the UE needs to acquire a
local IP address from the WLAN access network and it is not required to
connect to an N3IWF, ePDG or TNGF. If the WLAN access network is
configured to require the 5GS based access authentication of the UE for
connecting to the WLAN, the UE performs the authentication procedure for
Non-seamless WLAN offload in 5GS defined in clause 4.2.15 and in Annex S
of TS 33.501 \[29\]. After successful authentication, the UE is not
considered to be entered in 5GS Registered state. The UE can send and
receive traffic not traversing the 5GC and which is not under the
control of the 5GC.

A UE connected to a WLAN access network using 5GS credentials (as shown
in Figure 4.2.15-1), may also be connected to the 5GC, for example to
establish a PDU session. For example, the UE may connect to the 5GC
either via another access type (such as NG-RAN), or via the same WLAN
access network by performing the 5GS registration via Untrusted non-3GPP
access procedure (using N3IWF) or interworking between ePDG connected to
EPC and 5GS (using ePDG) defined in TS 23.502 \[03\].

When a UE is connected to a WLAN access network (e.g. using 5GS
credentials) and using an Untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE can perform
Non-Seamless Offload of some or all data traffic to this WLAN access
network sending the traffic outside the IPSec tunnel encapsulation as
defined in URSP rules with Non-Seamless Offload indication.

A UE may use the Registration procedure for Trusted non-3GPP access
defined in clause 4.12a.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[2\] and then determine to
send some traffic (to be subject to Non-seamless WLAN offload) outside
of the IPSec tunnel established with the TNGF.

NOTE: A UE cannot first connect to a WLAN access network using 5GS
credentials and without performing 5GS registration, and then later, on
this WLAN access network, perform 5GS registration using the Trusted
non-3GPP access procedure without first having to release the WLAN and
then to establish a new WLAN association per the Registration procedure
for Trusted non-3GPP access as defined in clause 4.12a.2.2 of
TS 23.502 \[2\].

When the UE decides to use 5G NSWO to connect to the WLAN access network
using its 5GS credentials but without registration to 5GS, the NAI
format for 5G NSWO is used whose realm is different than the realm
defined for usage of Trusted non-3GPP access to the 5GC (defined in
clauses 28.7.6 and 28.7.7 of TS 23.003 \[19\]).

The NAI format for 5G NSWO is defined in TS 23.003 \[19\].

# 6 Network Functions

## 6.1 General

Clause 6 provides the functional description of the Network Functions

context valid over a 3GPP access and a Non 3GPP access.

\- Support as described in clause 5.3.3.4 dedicated CM management
contexts for the UE for connectivity over non-3GPP access.

NOTE 2: Not all of the functionalities are required to be supported in
an instance of a Network Slice.

In addition to the functionalities of the AMF described above, the AMF
may include policy related functionalities as described in clause 6.2.8
of TS 23.503 \[45\].

The AMF uses the N14 interface for AMF re-allocation and AMF to AMF
information transfer. This interface may be either intra-PLMN or
inter-PLMN (e.g. in the case of inter-PLMN mobility).

In addition to the functionality of the AMF described above, the AMF may
include the following functionality to support monitoring in roaming
scenarios:

\- Normalization of reports according to roaming agreements between
VPLMN and HPLMN (e.g. change the location granularity in a report from
cell level to a level that is appropriate for the HPLMN); and

\- Generation of charging/accounting information for Monitoring Event
Reports that are sent to the HPLMN.

In addition to the functionality of the AMF described above, the AMF may
provide support for Network Slice restriction and Network Slice instance
restriction based on NWDAF analytics.

In addition to the functionalities of the AMF described above, the AMF
may provide support for the Disaster Roaming as described in
clause 5.40.

In addition to the functionalities of the AMF described above, the AMF
may also include following functionalities to support Network Slice
Admission Control:

\- Support of NSAC for maximum number of UEs as defined in clauses
5.15.11.1 and 5.15.11.3.

In addition to the functionality of the AMF described above, the AMF may
include the following functionality to support SNPNs:

\- Support for Onboarding of UEs for SNPNs.

In addition to the functionalities of the AMF described above, the AMF
may also include following functionalities to support satellite
backhaul:

\- Support for reporting satellite backhaul category (i.e. GEO, MEO, LEO
or OTHERSAT) and its modification based on AMF local configuration to

AF request for local information exposure and detecting there is a more
appropriate NEF instance to serve the AF\'s request.

\- The Network Exposure Function receives information from other network
functions (based on exposed capabilities of other network functions).
NEF stores the received information as structured data using a
standardized interface to a Unified Data Repository (UDR). The stored
information can be accessed and \"re-exposed\" by the NEF to other
network functions and Application Functions, and used for other purposes
such as analytics.

of the APIs specified for capability exposure.

NOTE: The NEF can access the UDR located in the same PLMN as the NEF.

The services provided by the NEF are specified in clause 7.2.8.

For external exposure of services related to specific UE(s), the NEF
resides in the HPLMN. Depending on operator agreements, the NEF in the
HPLMN may have interface(s) with NF(s) in the VPLMN.

When a UE is capable of switching between EPC and 5GC, an SCEF+NEF is
used for service exposure. See clause 5.17.5 for a description of the
SCEF+NEF.

NOTE 2: NWDAF functionality beyond its support for Nnwdaf is out of
scope of 3GPP.

### 6.2.19 SCP

The Service Communication Proxy (SCP) includes one or more of the
following functionalities. Some or all of the SCP functionalities may be
supported in a single instance of an SCP:

\- Indirect Communication (see clause 7.1.1 for details).

\- Delegated Discovery (see clauses 7.1.1 and 6.3.1 for details).

\- Message forwarding and routing to destination NF/NF service.

\- Message forwarding and routing to a next hop SCP.

\- Communication security (e.g. authorization of the NF Service Consumer
to access the NF Service Producer API), load balancing, monitoring,
overload control, etc.

\- Optionally interact with UDR, to resolve the UDM Group ID/UDR Group
ID/AUSF Group ID/PCF Group ID/CHF Group ID/HSS Group ID based on UE
identity, e.g. SUPI or IMPI/IMPU (see clause 6.3.1 for details).

NOTE 1: Communication security, e.g. authorization of the NF Service
Consumer to access the NF Service Producer\'s API is specified in
TS 33.501 \[29\].

NOTE 2: Load balancing, monitoring, overload control functionality
provided by the SCP is left up to implementation.

The SCP may be deployed in a distributed manner.

NOTE 3: More than one SCP can be present in the communication path
between NF Services.

SCPs can be deployed at PLMN level, shared-slice level and
slice-specific level. It is left to operator deployment to ensure that
SCPs can communicate with relevant NRFs.

In order to enable SCPs to route messages through several SCPs (i.e.
next SCP hop discovery, see clause 6.3.16), an SCP may register its
profile in the NRF. Alternatively, local configuration may be used.

### 6.2.20 W-AGF

The functionality of W-AGF is specified in TS 23.316 \[84\].

### 6.2.21 UE radio Capability Management Function (UCMF)

The UCMF is used for storage of dictionary entries corresponding to
either PLMN-assigned or Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.
An AMF may subscribe with the UCMF to obtain from the UCMF new values of
UE Radio Capability ID that the UCMF assigns for the purpose of caching
them locally.

Provisioning of Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID entries in
the UCMF is performed from an AF that interacts with the UCMF either
directly or via the NEF (or via Network Management) using a procedure
defined in TS 23.502 \[3\]. A UCMF that serves both EPS and 5GS shall
require provisioning the UE Radio Capability ID with the
TS 36.331 \[51\] format or TS 38.331 \[28\] format or both the formats
of the UE radio capabilities.

The UCMF also assigns the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID values.

Each PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is also associated to the TAC
of the UE model(s) that it is related to. When an AMF requests the UCMF
to assign a UE Radio Capability ID for a set of UE radio capabilities,
it indicates the TAC of the UE that the UE Radio Capability information
is related to.

The UCMF stores a Version ID value for the PLMN assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs so it is included in the PLMN assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs it assigns. This shall be configured in the UCMF.

The UCMF may be provisioned with a dictionary of Manufacturer-assigned
UE Radio Capability IDs which include a \"Vendor ID\" that applies to
the Manufacturers of these UE, and a list of TACs for which the PLMN has
obtained-Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.

A PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs is kept in the UCMF storage as
long as it is associated with at least a TAC value. When a TAC value is
related to a UE model that is earmarked for operation based on
Manufacturer assigned UE Radio Capability IDs, this TAC value is
disassociated in the UCMF from any PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability
IDs.

For the case that the PLMN is configured to store PLMN assigned IDs in
the Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list defined in
clause 4.4.1a, the UCMF does not remove from storage any PLMN assigned
UE Radio Capability ID no longer used, and rather quarantines it to
avoid any future reassignment.

A UCMF dictionary entry shall include also the related UE Radio
Capability for Paging for each RAT.

performing protocol translation and AUSF discovery (see clause 6.3.4).

## 6.3 Principles for Network Function and Network Function Service discovery and selection

### 6.3.1 General

The NF discovery and NF service discovery enable Core Network entities
(NFs or Service Communication Proxy (SCP)) to discover a set of NF
instance(s) and NF service instance(s) for a specific NF service or an
NF type. NF service discovery is enabled via the NF discovery procedure,
as specified in clauses 4.17.4, 4.17.5, 4.17.9 and 4.17.10 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

Unless the expected NF and NF service information is locally configured
on the requester NF, e.g. when the expected NF service or NF is in the
same PLMN as the requester NF, the NF and NF service discovery is
implemented via the Network Repository Function (NRF). NRF is the
logical function that is used to support the functionality of NF and NF
service discovery and status notification as specified in clause 6.2.6.

NOTE 1: NRF can be colocated together with SCP e.g. for communication
option D, depicted in Annex E.

In order for the requested NF type or NF service to be discovered via
the NRF, the NF instance need to be registered in the NRF. This is done
by sending a Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister containing the NF profile. The
NF profile contains information related to the NF instance, such as NF
instance ID, supported NF service instances (see clause 6.2.6 for more
details regarding the NF profile). The registration may take place e.g.
when the producer NF instance and its NF service instance(s) become
operative for the first time. The NF service registration procedure is
specified in clause 4.17.1 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

In order for the requester NF or SCP to obtain information about the NF
and/or NF service(s) registered or configured in a PLMN/slice, based on
local configuration the requester NF or SCP may initiate a discovery
procedure with the NRF by providing the type of the NF and optionally a
list of the specific service(s) it is attempting to discover. The
requester NF or SCP may also provide other service parameters e.g.
slicing related information. For the detailed service parameter(s) used
for specific NF and NF service discovery refer to clause 5.2.7.3.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. The requester NF may also provide NF Set related
information to enable reselection of NF instances within the NF set. The
requester NF may also provide the required supported features of the NF.

For some Network Functions which have access to the subscription data
(e.g. HSS, UDM) the NRF may need to resolve the NF Group ID
corresponding to a subscriber identifier. If the NRF has no stored
configuration mapping identity sets/ranges to NF Group ID locally, the
NRF may retrieve the NF Group ID corresponding to a specific subscriber
identifier from the UDR using the Nudr_GroupIDmap_Query service
operation.

In the case of Indirect Communication, a NF Service Consumer employs an
SCP which routes the request to the intended target of the request.

If the requester NF is configured to delegate discovery, the requester
NF may omit the discovery procedure with the NRF and instead delegate
the discovery to the SCP; the SCP will then act on behalf of the
requester NF. In this case, the requester NF adds any necessary
discovery and selection parameters to the request in order for the SCP
to be able to do discovery and associated selection. The SCP may
interact with the NRF to perform discovery and obtain discovery result
and it may interact with the NRF or UDR to obtain NF Group ID
corresponding to subscriber identifier.

NOTE 2: For delegated discovery of the HSS or the UDM, the SCP can rely
on the NRF to discover the group of HSS/UDM instance(s) serving the
provided user identity, or in some deployments the SCP can first query
the UDR for the HSS/UDM Group ID for the provided user identity. It is
expected that the stage 3 defines a single encoding for the user
identity provided by the service consumer that can be used for both
variants of delegated discovery to avoid that the service consumer needs
to be aware of the SCP behaviour.

The NRF provides a list of NF instances and NF service instances
relevant for the discovery criteria. The NRF may provide the IP address
or the FQDN of NF instance(s) and/or the Endpoint Address(es) of
relevant NF service instance(s) to the NF Consumer or SCP. The NRF may
also provide NF Set ID and/or NF Service Set ID to the NF Consumer or
SCP. The response contains a validity period during which the discovery
result is considered valid and can be cached. The result of the NF and
NF service discovery procedure is applicable to any subscriber that
fulfils the same discovery criteria. The entity that does the discovery
may cache the NF profile(s) received from the NF/NF service discovery
procedure. During the validity period, the cached NF profile(s) may be
used for NF selection for any subscriber matching the discovery
criteria.

NOTE 3: Refer to TS 29.510 \[58\] for details on using the validity
period.

In the case of Direct Communication, the requester NF uses the discovery
result to select NF instance and a NF service instance that is able to
provide a requested NF Service (e.g. a service instance of the PCF that
can provide Policy Authorization).

In the case of Indirect Communication without Delegated Discovery, the
requester NF uses the discovery result to select a NF instance while the
associated NF service instance selection may be done by the requester NF
and/or an SCP on behalf of the requester NF.

In both the cases above, the requester NF may use the information from a
valid cached discovery result for subsequent selections (i.e. the
requester NF does not need to trigger a new NF discovery procedure to
perform the selection).

In the case of Indirect Communication with Delegated Discovery, the SCP
will discover and select a suitable NF instance and NF service instance
based on discovery and selection parameters provided by the requester NF
and optional interaction with the NRF. The NRF to be used may be
provided by the NF consumer as part of the discovery parameters, e.g. as
a result of a NSSF query. The SCP may use the information from a valid
cached discovery result for subsequent selections (i.e. the SCP does not
need to trigger a new NF discovery procedure to perform the selection).

NOTE 4: In a given PLMN, Direct Communication, Indirect Communication,
or both may apply.

The requester NF or SCP may subscribe to receive notifications from the
NRF of a newly updated NF profile of an NF (e.g. NF service instances
taken in or out of service), or newly registered de-registered NF
instances. The NF/NF service status subscribe/notify procedure is
defined in clauses 4.17.7 and 4.17.8 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

For NF and NF service discovery across PLMNs, the NRF in the local PLMN
interacts with the NRF in the remote PLMN to retrieve the NF profile(s)
of the NF instance(s) in the remote PLMN that matches the discovery
criteria. The NRF in the local PLMN reaches the NRF in the remote PLMN
by forming a target PLMN specific query using the PLMN ID provided by
the requester NF. The NF/NF service discovery procedure across PLMNs is
specified in clause 4.17.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 5: See TS 29.510 \[58\] for details on using the target PLMN ID
specific query to reach the NRF in the remote PLMN.

For topology hiding, see clause 6.2.17.

#### 6.3.1.0 Principles for Binding, Selection and Reselection

Binding can be used to indicate suitable target NF producer instance(s)
for NF service instance selection, reselection and routing of subsequent
requests associated with a specific NF producer resource (context) and
NF service. This allows the NF producer to indicate that the NF
consumer, for a particular context, should be bound to an NF service
instance, NF instance, NF service set or NF set depending on local
policies and other criteria (e.g. at what point it is in the middle of a
certain procedure, considering performance aspects etc).

Binding can also be used by the NF consumer to indicate suitable NF
consumer instance(s) for notification target instance reselection and
routing of subsequent notification requests associated with a specific
notification subscription and for providing Binding Indication for
service(s) that the NF consumer produces for the same data context and
the NF service producer is subsequently likely to invoke.

The Binding Indication contains the information in Table 6.3.1.0-1.

The Routing Binding Indication may be included in Request, Subscribe or
Notification messages (see clause 7.1.2). It may be used in the case of
indirect communication by the SCP to route the message. The Routing
Binding Indication is a copy of the information in the Binding
Indication and also contains the information in Table 6.3.1.0-1.

NOTE 1: Subscription request messages can contain both a Binding
Indication and a Routing Binding Indication.

The NF service producer may provide a Binding Indication to the NF
service consumer as part of the Direct or Indirect Communication
procedures, to be used in subsequent related service requests. The level
of Binding Indication provided by the NF service producer to the NF
consumer indicates if the resource in the NF service producer is either
bound to NF service instance, NF instance, NF Service Set or NF set as
specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1. The Binding Indication may include NF
Service Set ID, NF Set ID, NF instance ID, or NF service instance ID,
for use by the NF consumer or SCP for NF Service Producer
(re-)selection. If the resource is created in the NF Service Producer,
the NF Service Producer provides resource information which includes the
endpoint address of the NF service producer. For indirect communication,
the NF service consumer copies the Binding Indication into the Routing
Binding Indication in Request or Subscribe message, unless the NF
service consumer performs a reselection for indirect communication
without delegated discovery.

During explicit or implicit notification subscription, a Binding
Indication may be provided by the NF service consumer to NF service
producer; the NF service consumer will also provide a Notification
Endpoint. The NF service consumer may also provide a Binding Indication
in response to notification requests. The level of Binding Indication
provided by the NF service consumer to the NF service provider indicates
if the Notification Endpoint is either bound to NF service instance, NF
instance, NF Service Set or NF set as specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1. The
Binding Indication shall include at least one of NF Set ID, NF instance
ID, NF Service Set ID and/or NF service instance ID, and may also
include the service name. The NF Service Set ID, NF service instance ID,
and service name relate to the service of the NF service consumer that
will handle the notification.

NOTE 2: The NF service can either be a standardised service as per this
specification or a custom service. The custom service can be used for
the sole purpose of registering endpoint address(es) to receive
notifications at the NRF.

The Binding Indication is used by the NF service producer as
notification sender to reselect an endpoint address and construct the
Notification Endpoint, i.e. the URI where the notification is to be
sent, e.g. if the provided Notification Endpoint of the NF service
consumer included in the subscription cannot be reached, according to
the following:

\- If the service name in the Binding Indication is omitted and the
binding for notification is on NF Set or NF Instance level, the endpoint
address registered in the NRF at NF Profile level of the NF(s) selected
according to the Binding Indication shall be used to construct a new
Notification Endpoint.

\- If the service name is included in the Binding Indication, an
endpoint address registered in the NRF for that service in the NF
profile(s) selected according to the Binding Indication shall be used to
construct a new Notification Endpoint.

For indirect communication, the NF service producer copies the Binding
Indication into the Routing Binding Indication that is included in the
Notification request, to be used by the SCP to discover an alternative
endpoint address and construct a Notification Endpoint e.g. if the
Notification Endpoint that the request targets cannot be reached,
according to the following:

\- If the service name in the Routing Binding Indication is omitted and
the binding for notification is on NF Set or NF Instance level, the
endpoint address registered in the NRF at NF Profile level of the NF(s)
selected according to the Binding Indication shall be used to construct
a new Notification Endpoint.

\- If the service name is included in the Routing Binding Indication, an
endpoint address registered in the NRF for that service in the NF
profile(s) selected according to the Binding Indication shall be used to
construct a new Notification Endpoint.

For subscription to notifications via another network function, a
separate Binding Indication for subscription related events may be
provided by the NF service consumer (see clause 4.17.12.4 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]) and if provided shall be associated with an
applicability indicating notification for subscription related events.

If the NF as an NF consumer provides a Binding Indication for services
that the NF produces in service requests, the Binding Indication shall
be associated with an applicability indicating other service and may
contain the related service name(s), in addition to the other parameters
listed in Table 6.3.1.0-1. If no service name(s) are provided, the
Binding Indication relates to all services that the NF produces.

For NF Set or NF Instance level of binding, a Binding Indication for
notifications and other services may be combined if it relates to the
same service, and that combined Binding Indication shall then be
associated with an applicability indicating all scenarios that the
Binding Indication relates to (For this purpose, the applicability can
indicate a combination of values).

If no applicability is indicated in a request or subscribe messages, a
Binding Indication in that messages is applicable for notification to
all events except for the subscription related event (see
clause 4.17.12.4 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

NOTE 3: Such a request message can be used for implicit subscription.

NOTE 4: Request messages can contain both the Binding Indications for
services and for notifications, and in addition, the Routing Binding
Indication in the case of indirect communication.

A Binding Indication may be shared by a group of resources (e.g.
contexts) identified by a group identifier. This enables a NF Service
consumer or producer to update the binding indication for this group of
resources in a single request or notification towards a given peer NF
service instance, e.g. when a group of resources need to be taken over
by a different NF within an NF set. See clause 6.12.1 of
TS 29.500 \[49\].

Table 6.3.1.0-1 defines the selection and reselection behaviour of NF
services consumers and SCPs depending on the Binding Indication provided
by an NF service producer. The detailed procedures refer to
clause 4.17.11 and 4.17.12 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 6.3.1.1 NF Discovery and Selection aspects relevant with indirect communication

For indirect communication shown in Annex E, the SCP performs the
following functionalities regarding Network Function and Network
Function Service discovery and selection:

\- If the request includes a Routing Binding Indication, the SCP shall
route the service request to the requested target as specified in Table
6.3.1.0-1. If the Routing Binding Indication does not exist, the SCP may
get the NF Set ID from the NRF or local configuration (if available).

\- If the request recipient had previously provided a Binding
Indication, then the request sender shall include a Routing Binding
Indication with the same contents in subsequent related requests.

#### 6.3.1.2 Location information

The location information describes the network location of the NF
instance. It can consist of one or more levels. Each level describes one
location aspect, such as geographic location, data centre, cluster, etc.
An NF instance has only one location.

The location information may be used to select the NF service instance
or NF instance from a particular network location based on local
configuration.

NOTE: The location information in TS 29.510 \[58\] specifies the
granularity of location information. It is up to each deployment to
determine the granularity of location information to be used.

### 6.3.2 SMF discovery and selection

The SMF selection functionality is supported by the AMF and SCP and is
used to allocate an SMF that shall manage the PDU Session. The SMF
selection procedures are described in clause 4.3.2.2.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The SMF discovery and selection functionality follows the principles
stated in clause 6.3.1.

If the AMF does discovery, the AMF shall utilize the NRF to discover SMF
instance(s) unless SMF information is available by other means, e.g.
locally configured on AMF. The AMF provides UE location information to
the NRF when trying to discover SMF instance(s). The NRF provides NF
profile(s) of SMF instance(s) to the AMF. In addition, the NRF also
provides the SMF service area of SMF instance(s) to the AMF. The SMF
selection functionality in the AMF selects an SMF instance and an SMF
service instance based on the available SMF instances obtained from NRF
or on the configured SMF information in the AMF.

NOTE 1: Protocol aspects of the access to NRF are specified in
TS 29.510 \[58\].

The SMF selection functionality is applicable to both 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access.

The SMF selection for Emergency services is described in
clause 5.16.4.5.

The following factors may be considered during the SMF selection:

a\) Selected Data Network Name (DNN). In the case of the home routed
roaming, the DNN is not applied for the V-SMF selection.

b\) S-NSSAI of the HPLMN (for non-roaming and home-routed roaming
scenarios), and S-NSSAI of the VPLMN (for roaming with local breakout
and home-routed roaming scenarios).

c\) NSI-ID.

NOTE 2: The use of NSI -ID in the network is optional and depends on the
deployment choices of the operator. If used, the NSI ID is associated
with S-NSSAI.

d\) Access technology being used by the UE.

e\) Support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.

f\) Subscription information from UDM, e.g.

\- per DNN: whether LBO roaming is allowed.

\- per S-NSSAI: the subscribed DNN(s).

\- per (S-NSSAI, subscribed DNN): whether LBO roaming is allowed.

\- per (S-NSSAI, subscribed DNN): whether EPC interworking is supported.

\- per (S-NSSAI, subscribed DNN): whether selecting the same SMF for all
PDU sessions to the same S-NSSAI and DNN is required.

g\) Void.

h\) Local operator policies.

NOTE 3: These policies can take into account whether the SMF to be
selected is an I-SMF or a V-SMF or a SMF.

i\) Load conditions of the candidate SMFs.

j\) Analytics (i.e. statistics or predictions) for candidate SMFs\' load
as received from NWDAF (see TS 23.288 \[86\]), if NWDAF is deployed.

k\) UE location (i.e. TA).

l\) Service Area of the candidate SMFs.

m\) Capability of the SMF to support a MA PDU Session.

n\) If interworking with EPS is required.

o\) Preference of V-SMF support. This is applicable only for V-SMF
selection in the case of home routed roaming.

p\) Target DNAI.

q\) Capability of the SMF to support User Plane Remote Provisioning (see
clause 5.30.2.10.4.3).

r\) Supported DNAI list.

To support the allocation of a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6
prefix as specified in clause 5.8.2.2.1, a dedicated SMF may be deployed
for the indicated combination of DNN and S-NSSAI and registered to the
NRF, or provided by the UDM as part of the subscription data.

In the case of delegated discovery, the AMF, shall send all the
available factors a)-d), k) and n) to the SCP.

In addition, the AMF may indicate to the SCP which NRF to use (in the
case of NRF dedicated to the target slice).

If there is an existing PDU Session and the UE requests to establish
another PDU Session to the same DNN and S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, and the UE
subscription data indicates the support for interworking with EPS for
this DNN and S-NSSAI of the HPLMN or UE subscription data indicates the
same SMF shall be selected for all PDU sessions to the same S-NSSAI,
DNN, the same SMF in non roaming and LBO case or the same H-SMF in home
routed roaming case, shall be selected. In addition, if the UE Context
in the AMF provides a SMF ID for an existing PDU session to the same
DNN, S-NSSAI, the AMF uses the stored SMF ID for the additional PDU
Session. In any such a case where the AMF can determine which SMF should
be selected, if delegated discovery is used, the AMF shall indicate a
desired NF Instance ID so that the SCP is able to route the message to
the relevant SMF. Otherwise, if UE subscription data does not indicate
the support for interworking with EPS for this DNN and S-NSSAI, a
different SMF in non roaming and LBO case or a different H-SMF in home
routed roaming case, may be selected. For example, to support a SMF load
balancing or to support a graceful SMF shutdown (e.g. a SMF starts to no
more take new PDU Sessions).

In the home-routed roaming case, the SMF selection functionality selects
an SMF in VPLMN based on the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN, as well as an SMF in
HPLMN based on the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN. This is specified in
clause 4.3.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

When the UE requests to establish a PDU Session to a DNN and an S-NSSAI
of the HPLMN, if the UE MM Core Network Capability indicates the UE
supports EPC NAS and optionally, if the UE subscription indicates the
support for interworking with EPS for this DNN and S-NSSAI of the HPLMN,
the selection functionality (in AMF or SCP) selects a combined
SMF+PGW-C. Otherwise, a standalone SMF may be selected.

If the UDM provides a subscription context that allows for handling the
PDU Session in the VPLMN (i.e. using LBO) for this DNN and S-NSSAI of
the HPLMN and, optionally, the AMF is configured to know that the VPLMN
has a suitable roaming agreement with the HPLMN of the UE, the following
applies:

\- If the AMF does discovery, the SMF selection functionality in AMF
selects an SMF from the VPLMN.

\- If delegated discovery is used, the SCP selects an SMF from the
VPLMN.

If an SMF in the VPLMN cannot be derived for the DNN and S-NSSAI of the
VPLMN, or if the subscription does not allow for handling the PDU
Session in the VPLMN using LBO, then the following applies:

\- If the AMF does discovery, both an SMF in VPLMN and an SMF in HPLMN
are selected, and the DNN and S-NSSAI of the HPLMN is used to derive an
SMF identifier from the HPLMN.

\- If delegated discovery is used:

\- The AMF performs discovery and selection of H-SMF from NRF. The AMF
may indicate the maximum number of H-SMF instances to be returned from
NRF, i.e. SMF selection at NRF.

\- The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to SCP, which
includes the endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected H-SMF, and the
discovery and selection parameters as defined in this clause, i.e.
parameter for V-SMF selection. The SCP performs discovery and selection
of the V-SMF and forwards the request to the selected V-SMF.

\- The V-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request towards the H-SMF
via the SCP; the V-SMF uses the received endpoint (e.g. URI) of the
selected H-SMF to construct the target destination to be addressed. The
SCP forwards the request to the H-SMF.

\- Upon reception of a response from V-SMF, based on the received V-SMF
ID the AMF obtains the Service Area of the V-SMF from NRF. The AMF uses
the Service Area of the V-SMF to determine the need for V-SMF relocation
upon subsequent UE mobility.

If the initially selected SMF in VPLMN (for roaming with LBO) detects it
does not understand information in the UE request, it may reject the N11
message (related with a PDU Session Establishment Request message) with
a proper N11 cause triggering the AMF to select both a new SMF in the
VPLMN and a SMF in the HPLMN (for home routed roaming).

The AMF selects SMF(s) considering support for CIoT 5GS optimisations
(e.g. Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation).

In the case of onboarding of UEs for SNPNs, when the UE is registered
for SNPN onboarding the AMF selects SMF(s) of Onboarding Network
considering the Capability of SMF to support User Plane Remote
Provisioning.

Additional details of AMF selection of an I-SMF are described in
clause 5.34.

In the case of home routed scenario, the AMF selects a new V-SMF if it
determines that the current V-SMF cannot serve the UE location. The
selection/relocation is same as an I-SMF selection/relocation as
described in clause 5.34.

### 6.3.3 User Plane Function Selection

#### 6.3.3.1 Overview

The selection and reselection of the UPF are performed by the SMF by
considering UPF deployment scenarios such as centrally located UPF and
distributed UPF located close to or at the Access Network site. The
selection of the UPF shall also enable deployment of UPF with different
capabilities, e.g. UPFs supporting no or a subset of optional
functionalities.

For home routed roaming case, the UPF(s) in home PLMN is selected by
SMF(s) in HPLMN, and the UPF(s) in the VPLMN is selected by SMF(s) in
VPLMN. The exact set of parameters used for the selection mechanism is
deployment specific and controlled by the operator configuration.

The UPF selection involves:

\- a step of SMF Provisioning of available UPF(s). This step may take
place while there is no PDU Session to establish and may be followed by
N4 Node Level procedures defined in clause 4.4.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]
where the UPF and the SMF may exchange information such as the support
of optional functionalities and capabilities.

\- A step of selection of an UPF for a particular PDU Session; it is
followed by N4 session management procedures defined in clause 4.4.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 6.3.3.2 SMF Provisioning of available UPF(s)

SMF may be locally configured with the information about the available
UPFs, e.g. by OA&M system when UPF is instantiated or removed.

NOTE 1: UPF information can be updated e.g. by OA&M system any time
after the initial provisioning, or UPF itself updates its information to
the SMF any time after the node level interaction is established.

The UPF selection functionality in the SMF may optionally utilize the
NRF to discover UPF instance(s). In this case, the SMF issues a request
to the NRF that may include following parameters: DNN, S-NSSAI, SMF Area
Identity, ATSSS steering capabilities. In its answer, the NRF provides
the NF profile(s) that include(s) the IP address(es) or the FQDN of the
N4 interface of corresponding UPF instance(s) to the SMF.

UPFs may be associated with an SMF Area Identity in the NRF. This allows
limiting the SMF provisioning of UPF(s) using NRF to those UPF(s)
associated with a certain SMF Area Identity. This can e.g. be used in
the case that an SMF is only allowed to control UPF(s) configured in NRF
as belonging to a certain SMF Area Identity.

The NRF may be configured by OAM with information on the available
UPF(s) or the UPF instance(s) may register its/their NF profile(s) in
the NRF. This is further defined in clause 4.17 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

#### 6.3.3.3 Selection of an UPF for a particular PDU Session

If there is an existing PDU Session, and the SMF receives another PDU
Session request to the same DNN and S-NSSAI, and if the SMF determines
that interworking with EPC is supported for this PDU Session as
specified in clause 4.11.5 of TS 23.502 \[3\], the SMF should select the
same UPF, otherwise, if the SMF determines that interworking with EPC is
not supported for the new PDU Session, a different UPF may be selected.

For the same DNN and S-NSSAI if different UPF are selected at 5GC, when
the UE is moved to EPC network, there is no requirement to enforce
APN-AMBR. Whether and how to apply APN-AMBR for the PDN Connection
associated with this DNN/APN is implementation dependent, e.g. possibly
only AMBR enforcement per PDU Session applies.

The following parameter(s) and information may be considered by the SMF
for UPF selection and re-selection:

\- UPF\'s dynamic load.

\- Analytics (i.e. statistics or predictions) for UPF load, Service
Experience analytics and/or DN Performance analytics per UP path
(including UPF and/or DNAI and/or AS instance) and UE related analytics
(UE mobility, UE communication, and expected UE behavioural parameters)
as received from NWDAF (see TS 23.288 \[86\]), if NWDAF is deployed.

\- UPF\'s relative static capacity among UPFs supporting the same DNN.

\- UPF location available at the SMF.

\- UE location information.

\- Capability of the UPF and the functionality required for the
particular UE session: An appropriate UPF can be selected by matching
the functionality and features required for an UE.

\- Data Network Name (DNN).

\- PDU Session Type (i.e. IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet Type or
Unstructured Type) and if applicable, the static IP address/prefix.

\- SSC mode selected for the PDU Session.

\- UE subscription profile in UDM.

\- DNAI as included in the PCC Rules and described in clause 5.6.7.

\- Local operator policies.

\- S-NSSAI.

\- Access technology being used by the UE.

\- Information related to user plane topology and user plane
terminations, that may be deduced from:

\- 5G-AN-provided identities (e.g. CellID, TAI), available UPF(s) and
DNAI(s);

\- Identifiers (i.e. a FQDN and/or IP address(es)) of N3 terminations
provided by a W-AGF or a TNGF or a TWIF;

\- Information regarding the user plane interfaces of UPF(s). This
information may be acquired by the SMF using N4;

\- Information regarding the N3 User Plane termination(s) of the AN
serving the UE. This may be deduced from 5G-AN-provided identities (e.g.
CellID, TAI);

\- Information regarding the N9 User Plane termination(s) of UPF(s) if
needed;

\- Information regarding the User plane termination(s) corresponding to
DNAI(s).

\- RSN, support for redundant GTP-U path or support for redundant
transport path in the transport layer (as in clause 5.33.2) when
redundant UP handling is applicable.

\- Information regarding the ATSSS Steering Capability of the UE session
(ATSSS-LL capability, MPTCP capability, or both) and information on the
UPF support of RTT measurements without PMF.

\- Support for UPF allocation of IP address/prefix.

\- Support of the IPUPS functionality, specified in clause 5.8.2.14.

\- Support for High latency communication (see clause 5.31.8).

\- User Plane Latency Requirements within AF request (see clause 5.6.7.1
and clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.548 \[130\]).

NOTE 1: How the SMF determines information about the user plane network
topology from information listed above, and what information is
considered by the SMF, is based on operator configuration.

NOTE 2: In this release the SMF uses no additional parameters for UPF
selection for a PDU Session serving TSC. If a PDU Session of a specific
DS-TT needs to connect to a specific UPF hosting a specific TSN 5GS
bridge, this can be achieved e.g. by using a dedicated DNN/S-NSSAI
combination.

A W-AGF or a TNGF may provide Identifiers of its N3 terminations when
forwarding over N2 uplink NAS signalling to the 5GC. The AMF may relay
this information to the SMF, as part of session management signalling
for a new PDU Session.

### 6.3.4 AUSF discovery and selection

In the case of NF consumer based discovery and selection, the following
applies:

\- The AMF and the NSWOF perform AUSF selection to allocate an AUSF
Instance that performs authentication between the UE and 5G CN in the
HPLMN. The AMF and the NSWOF shall utilize the NRF to discover the AUSF
instance(s) unless AUSF information is available by other means, e.g.
locally configured on AMF and on NSWOF. The AUSF selection function in
the AMF and in the NSWOF selects an AUSF instance based on the available
AUSF instances (obtained from the NRF or locally configured in the AMF).

\- The UDM shall utilize the NRF to discover the AUSF instance(s) unless
AUSF information is available by other means, e.g. locally configured on
UDM. The UDM selects an AUSF instance based on the available AUSF
instance(s) obtained from the NRF or based on locally configured
information, and information stored (by the UDM) from a previously
successful authentication.

AUSF selection is applicable to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

The AUSF selection function in AUSF NF consumers or in SCP should
consider one of the following factors when available:

1\. Home Network Identifier (e.g. MNC and MCC, realm) of SUCI/SUPI (by
an NF consumer in the Serving network) along with the selected NID
(provided by the NG-RAN) in the case of SNPN, Routing Indicator and
optionally Home Network Public Key identifier (e.g. in the case that
Routing Indicator is not enough to provide SUPI range granularity).

NOTE 1: The UE provides the SUCI, which contains the Routing Indicator
and Home Network Public Key identifier as defined in TS 23.003 \[19\],
to the AMF during initial registration and to the NSWOF during NSWO
authentication. The AMF can provide the UE\'s Routing Indicator and
optionally Home Network Public Key identifier to other AMFs as described
in TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 2: The usage of Home Network Public Key identifier for AUSF
discovery is limited to the scenario where the AUSF NF consumers belong
to the same PLMN as AUSF.

NOTE 3: In the case of SNPN and if the UE provides an IMSI type SUCI to
the AMF and the SUCI provided by UE or the SUPI derived from the SUCI is
for an SNPN served by the AMF, the AMF uses the selected NID provided by
the NG-RAN together with the selected PLMN ID (from IMSI) or the Routing
Indicator provided by the UE within the SUCI for selection of AUSF. In
the case of SNPN and the UE provides an NSI type SUCI to the AMF, the
AMF uses the Home Network Identifier and Routing Indicator of SUCI/SUPI
for selection of AUSF.

When the UE\'s Routing Indicator is set to its default value as defined
in TS 23.003 \[19\], the AUSF NF consumer can select any AUSF instance
within the home network for the UE.

2\. AUSF Group ID the UE\'s SUPI belongs to.

NOTE 4: The AMF can infer the AUSF Group ID the UE\'s SUPI belongs to,
based on the results of AUSF discovery procedures with NRF. The AMF
provides the AUSF Group ID the SUPI belongs to other AMFs as described
in TS 23.502 \[3\].

3\. SUPI; e.g. the AMF selects an AUSF instance based on the SUPI range
the UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on the results of a discovery
procedure with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI as input for AUSF discovery.

NOTE 5: In the case of Onboarding via ON-SNPN, AUSF instances supporting
UE onboarding can be registered in NRF or locally configured in the AMF.
The AMF in ON-SNPN can discover and select AUSF instance(s) supporting
UE onboarding based on the MCC and MNC or realm part in Home Network
Identifier of the SUCI/SUPI provided by the onboarding UE.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, the AUSF NF
consumer shall send all available factors to the SCP.

### 6.3.5 AMF discovery and selection

The AMF discovery and selection functionality is applicable to both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access.

The AMF selection functionality can be supported by the 5G-AN (e.g. RAN,
N3IWF) and is used to select an AMF instance for a given UE. An AMF
supports the AMF selection functionality to select an AMF for relocation
or because the initially selected AMF was not an appropriate AMF to
serve the UE (e.g. due to change of Allowed NSSAI). Other CP NF(s), e.g.
SMF, supports the AMF selection functionality to select an AMF from the
AMF set when the original AMF serving a UE is unavailable.

5G-AN selects an AMF Set and an AMF from the AMF Set under the following
circumstances:

1\) When the UE provides no 5G-S-TMSI nor the GUAMI to the 5G-AN.

2\) When the UE provides 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI but the routing information
(i.e. AMF identified based on AMF Set ID, AMF pointer) present in the
5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI is not sufficient and/or not usable (e.g. UE provides
GUAMI with an AMF region ID from a different region).

3\) AMF has instructed AN that the AMF (identified by GUAMI(s)) is
unavailable and no target AMF is identified and/or AN has detected that
the AMF has failed.

4\) When the UE attempts to establish a signalling connection, and the
following conditions are met:

\- the 5G-AN knows in what country the UE is located; and

\- the 5G-AN is connected to AMFs serving different PLMNs of different
countries; and

\- the UE provides a 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI, which indicates an AMF serving
a different country to where the UE is currently located; and

\- the 5G-AN is configured to enforce selection of the AMF based on the
country the UE is currently located.

Then the 5G-AN shall select an AMF serving a PLMN corresponding to the
UE\'s current location. How 5G-AN selects the AMF in this case is
defined in TS 38.410 \[125\].

NOTE: AMF selection case 4) does not apply if 5G-AN nodes serves one
country only.

In the case of NF Service Consumer based discovery and selection, the CP
NF selects an AMF from the AMF Set under the following circumstances:

\- When the AMF has instructed CP NF that a certain AMF identified by
GUAMI(s) is unavailable and the CP NF was not notified of target AMF;
and/or

\- CP NF has detected that the AMF has failed; and/or

\- When the selected AMF does not support the UE\'s Preferred Network
Behaviour; and/or

\- When the selected AMF does not support the High Latency communication
for NR RedCap UE.

In the case of delegated discovery and associated selection, the SCP
selects an AMF from the corresponding AMF Set under the following
circumstances:

\- The SCP gets an indication \"select new AMF within SET\" from the CP
NF; and/or

\- SCP has detected that the AMF has failed.

The AMF selection functionality in the 5G-AN may consider the following
factors for selecting the AMF Set:

\- AMF Region ID and AMF Set ID derived from GUAMI;

\- Requested NSSAI;

\- Local operator policies;

\- 5G CIoT features indicated in RRC signalling by the UE;

\- IAB-indication;

\- NB-IoT RAT Type;

\- Category M Indication;

\- NR RedCap Indication;

\- SNPN Onboarding indication as indicated in RRC signalling by the UE.

AMF selection functionality in the 5G-AN or CP NFs or SCP considers the
following factors for selecting an AMF from AMF Set:

\- Availability of candidate AMF(s).

\- Load balancing across candidate AMF(s) (e.g. considering weight
factors of candidate AMFs in the AMF Set).

\- In 5G-AN, 5G CIoT features indicated in RRC signalling by the UE.

\- In 5G-AN, SNPN Onboarding indication as indicated in RRC signalling
by the UE.

When the UE accesses the 5G-AN with a 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI that identifies
more than one AMF (as configured during N2 setup procedure), the 5G-AN
selects the AMF considering the weight factors.

When 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI provided by the UE to the 5G-AN contains an AMF
Set ID that is usable, and the AMF identified by AMF pointer that is not
usable (e.g. AN detects that the AMF has failed) or the corresponding
AMF indicates it is unavailable (e.g. out of operation) then the 5G-AN
uses the AMF Set ID for selecting another AMF from the AMF set
considering the factors above.

The discovery and selection of AMF in the CP NFs or SCP follows the
principle in clause 6.3.1

In the case of NF Service Consumer based discovery and selection, the
AMF or other CP NFs shall utilize the NRF to discover the AMF
instance(s) unless AMF information is available by other means, e.g.
locally configured on AMF or other CP NFs. The NRF provides the NF
profile(s) of AMF instance(s) to the AMF or other CP NFs. The AMF
selection function in the AMF or other CP NFs selects an AMF instance as
described below:

When NF Service Consumer performs discovery and selection the following
applies:

\- In the case of AMF discovery and selection functionality in AMF or
other CP NFs use GUAMI (in the SNPN case, along with NID of the SNPN
that owns the AMF instances to be discovered and selected) or TAI to
discover the AMF instance(s), the NRF provides the NF profile of the
associated AMF instance(s). If an associated AMF is unavailable due to
AMF planned removal, the NF profile of the backup AMF used for planned
removal is provided by the NRF. If an associated AMF is unavailable due
to AMF failure, the NF profile of the backup AMF used for failure is
provided by the NRF. If AMF pointer value in the GUAMI is associated
with more than one AMF, the NRF provides all the AMFs associated with
this AMF pointer value. If no AMF instances related to the indicated
GUAMI can be found, the NRF may provide a list of NF profiles of
candidate AMF instances in the same AMF Set. The other CP NF or AMF may
select any AMF instance from the list of candidate AMF instances. If no
NF profiles of AMF is returned in the discovery result, the other CP NF
or AMF may discover an AMF using the AMF Set as below.

\- In the case of AMF discovery and selection functionality in AMF use
AMF Set to discover AMF instance(s), the NRF provides a list of NF
profiles of AMF instances in the same AMF Set.

\- At intra-PLMN mobility, the AMF discovery and selection functionality
in AMF may use AMF Set ID, AMF Region ID, the target location
information, S-NSSAI(s) of Allowed NSSAI to discover target AMF
instance(s). The NRF provides the target NF profiles matching the
discovery.

\- At intra-SNPN mobility, the AMF discovery and selection functionality
in AMF may use AMF Set ID, AMF Region ID (along with NID of the SNPN
that owns the AMF instances to be discovered and selected), the target
location information, S-NSSAI(s) of Allowed NSSAI, AMF support of SNPN
Onboarding (if the UE is registered for SNPN Onboarding) to discover
target AMF instance(s). The NRF provides the target NF profiles matching
the discovery.

\- At inter PLMN mobility, the source AMF selects an AMF instance(s) in
the target PLMN by querying target PLMN level NRF via the source PLMN
level NRF with target PLMN ID. The target PLMN level NRF returns an AMF
instance address based on the target operator configuration. After the
Handover procedure the AMF may select a different AMF instance as
specified in clause 4.2.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

In the context of Network Slicing, the AMF selection is described in
clause 5.15.5.2.1.

When delegated discovery and associated selection is used, the following
applies:

\- If the CP NF includes GUAMI or TAI in the request, the SCP selects an
AMF instance associated with the GUAMI or TAI and sends the request to a
selected AMF service instance if it is available. The following also
applies:

\- If none of the associated AMF service instances are available due to
AMF planned removal, an AMF service instance from the backup AMF used
for planned removal is selected by the SCP;

\- If none of the associated AMF service instances are available due to
AMF failure, an AMF service instance from the backup AMF used for
failure is selected by the SCP;

\- If no AMF service instances related to the indicated GUAMI (in the
SNPN case, along with NID of the SNPN that owns the AMF instances to be
discovered and selected) can be found the SCP selects an AMF instance
from the AMF Set; or

\- AMF Pointer value used by more than one AMF, SCP selects one of the
AMF instances associated with the AMF Pointer.

\- If the CP NF includes AMF Set ID in the request, the SCP selects
AMF/AMF service instances in the provided AMF Set.

\- At intra-PLMN mobility, if a target AMF instance needs to be
selected, the AMF may provide AMF Set ID, AMF Region ID, and the target
location information, S-NSSAI(s) of Allowed NSSAI in the request,
optionally NRF to use. The SCP will select a target AMF instance
matching the discovery.

\- At intra-SNPN mobility, if a target AMF instance needs to be
selected, the AMF may provide AMF Set ID, AMF Region ID along with NID
of the SNPN that owns the AMF instances to be discovered and selected,
and the target location information, S-NSSAI(s) of Allowed NSSAI, AMF
support of SNPN Onboarding in the request (if the UE is registered for
SNPN Onboarding), optionally NRF to use. The SCP will select a target
AMF instance matching the discovery.

\- At inter PLMN mobility, the source AMF selects indicates \"roaming\"
to the SCP. The SCP interacts with the NRF in source PLMN so that the
NRF in source PLMN can discover an AMF in the target PLMN via target
PLMN NRF.

### 6.3.6 N3IWF selection

#### 6.3.6.1 General

When the UE supports connectivity with N3IWF but does not support
connectivity with ePDG, as specified in TS 23.402 \[43\], the UE shall
perform the procedure in clause 6.3.6.2 for selecting an N3IWF.

When the UE supports connectivity with N3IWF, as well as with ePDG, as
specified in TS 23.402 \[43\], the UE shall perform the procedure in
clause 6.3.6.3 for selecting either an N3IWF or an ePDG, i.e. for
selecting a non-3GPP access node.

In both cases above the UE can be configured by the HPLMN with the same
information that includes:

1\) ePDG identifier configuration: It contains the FQDN or IP address of
the ePDG in the HPLMN, as specified in clause 4.5.4.3 of
TS 23.402 \[43\]. This is used only when the UE supports connectivity
with ePDG and attempts to select an ePDG. It is ignored in all other
cases.

2\) N3IWF identifier configuration: It contains the FQDN or IP address
of the N3IWF in the HPLMN.

3\) Non-3GPP access node selection information: It contains a
prioritized list of PLMNs and for each PLMN it includes (i) a
\"Preference\" parameter which indicates if ePDG or N3IWF is preferred
in this PLMN and (ii) an FQDN parameter which indicates if the
Tracking/Location Area Identity FQDN or the Operator Identifier FQDN (as
specified in clause 4.5.4.4 of TS 23.402 \[43\]) should be used when
discovering the address of an ePDG or N3IWF in this PLMN. The list of
PLMNs shall include the HPLMN and shall include an \"any PLMN\" entry,
which matches any PLMN the UE is connected to except the HPLMN.

The ePDG identifier configuration and the N3IWF identifier configuration
are optional parameters, while the Non-3GPP access node selection
information is required and shall include at least the HPLMN and the
\"any PLMN\" entry.

If the ePDG identifier configuration is configured in the UE, then, when
the UE decides to select an ePDG in the HPLMN (according to the
procedure in clause 6.3.6.3), the UE shall use the ePDG identifier
configuration to find the IP address of the ePDG in the HPLMN and shall
ignore the FQDN parameter of the HPLMN in the Non-3GPP access node
selection information.

If the N3IWF identifier configuration is configured in the UE, then,
when the UE decides to select an N3IWF in the HPLMN (according to the
procedure in clause 6.3.6.3 for combined N3IWF/ePDG selection and the
procedure in clause 6.3.6.2 for Stand-alone N3IWF selection), the UE
shall use the N3IWF identifier configuration to find the IP address of
the N3IWF in the HPLMN and shall ignore the FQDN parameter of the HPLMN
in the Non-3GPP access node selection information.

The HPLMN provides to the UE the Non-3GPP access node selection
information and the N3IWF identifier configuration by taking into
account the UE\'s subscribed S-NSSAIs.

NOTE 2: If the HPLMN deploys multiple N3IWFs with different TAs which
support different S-NSSAIs, then the HPLMN can configure a UE with N3IWF
identifier configuration so that the UE selects an N3IWF that supports
the UE\'s subscribed S-NSSAIs.

#### 6.3.6.2 Stand-alone N3IWF selection

The UE performs N3IWF selection based on the ePDG selection procedure as
specified in clause 4.5.4 of TS 23.402 \[43\] except for the following
differences:

\- The Tracking/Location Area Identifier FQDN shall be constructed by
the UE based only on the Tracking Area wherein the UE is located. The
N3IWF Tracking/Location Area Identifier FQDN may use the 5GS TAI when
the UE is registered to the 5GS, or the EPS TAI when the UE is
registered to EPS. The Location Area is not applicable on the 3GPP
access.

\- The ePDG Operator Identifier (OI) FQDN format is substituted by with
N3IWF OI FQDN format as specified in TS 23.003 \[19\].

\- The ePDG identifier configuration and the ePDG selection information
are substituted by the N3IWF identifier configuration and the Non-3GPP
access node selection information respectively. The UE shall give
preference to the N3IWF in all PLMNs in the Non-3GPP access node
selection information independent of the \"Preference\" parameter.

\- If the UE determines to be located in a country other than its home
country (called the visited country), then instead of clause 4.5.4.4,
bullet 3 of TS 23.402 \[43\], the following applies:

a\) If the UE is registered via 3GPP access to a PLMN and this PLMN is
included in the Non-3GPP access node selection information, then the UE
shall select an N3IWF in this PLMN. If the UE fails to connect to an
N3IWF in this PLMN, the UE shall select an N3IWF by performing the DNS
procedure specified in clause 4.5.4.5 of TS 23.402 \[43\].

b\) In all other cases, (e.g. when the UE is not configured with the
Non-3GPP access node selection information, or the UE is registered via
3GPP access to a PLMN but this PLMN is not included in the Non-3GPP
access node selection information, or the UE is not registered via 3GPP
access to any PLMN), the UE shall select an N3IWF by performing the DNS
procedure specified in clause 4.5.4.5 of TS 23.402 \[43\].

Network slice information cannot be used for N3IWF selection in this
Release of the specification.

If the UE is accessing PLMN services via SNPN, the UE uses the procedure
defined in this clause to select an N3IWF deployed in the PLMN. If the
UE is accessing standalone non-public network service via a PLMN (see
supported cases in clause 5.30.2.0), the UE uses the procedure defined
in clause 6.3.6.2a.

#### 6.3.6.2a SNPN N3IWF selection

In this Release of the specification this procedure only applies when
the UE is accessing the SNPN N3IWF via a PLMN.

The UE shall first determine the country in which it is located. If the
UE cannot determine the country in which the UE is located, the UE shall
stop N3IWF selection and abort the attempt to access the SNPN via PLMN.

NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation how to determine the country in
which the UE is located.

If the UE determines that it is located in the country where the
configured N3IWF is located, then the UE uses the configured N3IWF FQDN
to select an N3IWF deployed in the SNPN.

If the UE determines that it is located in a country different from the
country where the configured N3IWF is located (called the visited
country), then:

\- The UE shall construct an FQDN consisting of the SNPN ID of the SNPN
subscription and the Visited Country FQDN and indicating the query is
for SNPN, as specified in TS 23.003 \[19\] and perform a DNS query for
the resulting FQDN.

\- If the DNS response contains no records, then the UE determines that
the visited country does not mandate the selection of an N3IWF in this
country for the SNPN identified by the SNPN ID provided by the UE. In
this case the UE uses the configured N3IWF FQDN to select an N3IWF
deployed in the SNPN.

\- If no DNS response is received, the UE shall stop the N3IWF
selection.

NOTE 2: The DNS can be configured to return no records for the visited
country regardless of the SNPN ID provided by the UE. This addresses the
scenario that the visited country in general does not mandate selection
of a local N3IWF.

\- If the DNS response contains one or more records, then the UE
determines that the visited country mandates the selection of an N3IWF
in this country. Each record in the DNS response shall contain the
identity of an N3IWF of the SNPN in the visited country which may be
used for N3IWF selection. In this case:

\- The UE shall select an N3IWF included in the DNS response based on
its own implementation means.

\- If the UE cannot select any N3IWF included in the DNS response, then
the UE shall stop the N3IWF selection.

NOTE 3: Visited countries which mandate the selection of an N3IWF in the
country are assumed to configure the DNS as follows:

\(i\) For SNPNs that do not have any dedicated N3IWFs in the country and
which are not exempt from the requirement to select an N3IWF in the
visited country, the DNS response contains a record that cannot be
resolved to an IP address;

\(ii\) for SNPNs that have dedicated N3IWFs in the country, the DNS
response contains the identities of the SNPN\'s N3IWFs in the visited
country;

\(iii\) for SNPNs that are exempt from the requirement to select an
N3IWF in the visited country, the DNS response contains no records.

NOTE 4: Self-assigned NIDs are not supported, since a DNS cannot be
properly configured for multiple SNPNs using the same self-assigned NID
(i.e. in collision scenarios). If the visited country mandates the
selection of an N3IWF in the same country, the NAPTR record(s)
associated to the Visited Country FQDN of SNPNs that use a self-assigned
NID can be provisioned with the replacement field containing an FQDN
that cannot be resolved to an IP address.

NOTE 5: The identity of an SNPN\'s N3IWF in the visited country can be
any FQDN, i.e. is not required to include the SNPN ID.

NOTE 6: It is assumed that the AMF, SMF, UPF are located in the same
country as the N3IWF.

#### 6.3.6.3 Combined N3IWF/ePDG Selection

When the UE wants to select a non-3GPP access node (either an N3IWF or
an ePDG), the UE shall perform the following procedure:

1\) The UE shall attempt to determine the country it is located in. This
is determined by implementation-specific methods not defined in this
specification. If the UE cannot determine the country it is located in,
the UE shall stop the non-3GPP access node selection.

2\) If the UE determines to be located in its home country, then:

a\) The UE shall select the HPLMN. If the UE fails to connect to an
ePDG/N3IWF in the HPLMN, then the UE shall stop the non-3GPP access node
selection.

3\) If the UE determines to be located in a country other than its home
country (called the visited country), then:

a\) If the UE is registered via 3GPP access to a PLMN and this PLMN is
included in the Non-3GPP access node selection information, then the UE
shall select this PLMN. If the UE fails to connect to an ePDG/N3IWF in
this PLMN, the UE shall select another PLMN by performing the DNS
procedure specified in bullet 3c) below.

b\) In all other cases, (e.g. when the UE is not configured with the
Non-3GPP access node selection information, or the UE is registered via
3GPP access to a PLMN but this PLMN is not included in the Non-3GPP
access node selection information, or the UE is not registered via 3GPP
access to any PLMN), the UE shall select a PLMN by performing the DNS
procedure specified in bullet 3c) below.

c\) The UE shall select a PLMN as follows:

i\) The UE shall determine if the non-3GPP access node selection is
required for an IMS service or for a non-IMS service. The means of that
determination are implementation specific.

ii\) If the UE determines that the non-3GPP access node selection is
required for a non-IMS service, the UE shall select a PLMN as specified
in clause 6.3.6.2. As defined below, if the UE fails to connect to an
N3IWF in any PLMN, the UE may attempt to select an ePDG according to the
procedure specified in clause 4.5.4.5 of TS 23.402 \[43\].

iii\) If the UE determines that the non-3GPP access node selection is
required for an IMS service, the UE shall select a PLMN as follows:

\- First, the UE shall perform a DNS query using the Visited Country
FQDN for N3IWF, as specified in TS 23.003 \[19\] to determine if the
visited country mandates the selection of N3IWF in this country. The DNS
response received by the UE may be empty or may contain the identities
of one or more PLMNs in the visited country, which may be used for N3IWF
selection, if the UE decides to select an N3IWF, as specified below. For
example, the DNS response may contain the identity of PLMN-1 and the
identity of PLMN-2.

\- Then, the UE shall perform a DNS query using the Visited Country FQDN
for ePDG, as specified in TS 23.003 \[19\] to determine if the visited
country mandates the selection of ePDG in this country. The DNS response
received by the UE may be empty or may contain the identities of one or
more PLMNs in the visited country, which may be used for ePDG selection,
if the UE decides to select an ePDG, as specified below. For example,
the DNS response may contain the identity of PLMN-1 and the identity of
PLMN-3.

\- If the UE does not receive a DNS response in none of the above two
DNS queries, then the UE shall stop the non-3GPP access node selection.
Otherwise, the next steps are executed.

\- The UE shall consolidate the PLMN identities received in the above
two DNS responses and shall construct a candidate list of PLMNs. For
example, the candidate list of PLMNs may contain the identities of
PLMN-1, PLMN-2, PLMN-3.

\- If the candidate list of PLMNs is empty, then:

\- If the Non-3GPP access node selection information contains one or
more PLMNs in the visited country, the UE shall select one of these
PLMNs based on their priorities in the Non-3GPP access node selection
information. If the UE fails to connect to a non-3GPP access node in any
of these PLMNs, the UE shall select the HPLMN.

\- Otherwise, the UE shall select the HPLMN.

\- If the candidate list of PLMNs is not empty, then:

\- If the UE is registered via 3GPP access to a PLMN which is included
in the candidate list of PLMNs, then the UE shall select this PLMN. If
the UE fails to connect to a non-3GPP access node in this PLMN, then the
UE shall select a different PLMN included in the candidate list of PLMNs
as specified in the next bullet.

\- If the UE is registered via 3GPP access to a PLMN which is not
included in the candidate list of PLMNs, or the UE is not registered via
3GPP access to any PLMN, or the UE fails to connect to a non-3GPP access
node according to the previous bullet, then the UE shall select one of
the PLMNs included in the candidate list of PLMNs based on the
prioritized list of PLMNs in the Non-3GPP access node selection
information (i.e. the UE shall select first the highest priority PLMN in
the Non-3GPP access node selection information that is contained in the
candidate list of PLMNs). If the Non-3GPP access node selection
information does not contain any of the PLMNs in the candidate list of
PLMNs, or the UE is not configured with the Non-3GPP access node
selection information, or the UE was not able to connect to a non-3GPP
access node in any of the PLMNs included in the Non-3GPP access node
selection information and in the candidate list of PLMN, then the UE
shall select a PLMN included in the candidate list of PLMNs based on its
own implementation means.

\- If the UE cannot select a non-3GPP access node in any of the PLMNs
included in the candidate list of PLMNs, then the UE shall stop the
non-3GPP access node selection.

In the selected PLMN the UE shall attempt to select a non-3GPP access
node as follows:

1\. The UE shall determine if the non-3GPP access node selection is
required for an IMS service or for a non-IMS service. The means of that
determination are implementation-specific.

2\. When the selection is required for an IMS service, the UE shall
choose a non-3GPP access node type (i.e. ePDG or N3IWF) based on the
\"Preference\" parameter specified in clause 6.3.6.1, unless the UE has
its 5GS capability disabled in which case it shall choose an ePDG
independent of the \"Preference\" parameter setting.

If the \"Preference\" parameter for the selected PLMN indicates that
ePDG is preferred, the UE shall attempt to select an ePDG. If the
\"Preference\" parameter for the selected PLMN indicates that N3IWF is
preferred, the UE shall attempt to select an N3IWF.

If the selection fails, including the case when, during the registration
performed over either 3GPP or non-3GPP access, the UE receives the IMS
Voice over PS session Not Supported over Non-3GPP Access indication
(specified in clause 5.16.3.2a), the UE shall attempt selecting the
other non-3GPP access node type in the selected PLMN, if any. If that
selection fails too, or it is not possible, then the UE shall select
another PLMN, according to the procedure specified bullet 3c) above.

3\. When the selection is required for a non-IMS service, the UE shall
perform the selection by giving preference to the N3IWF independent of
the \"Preference\" parameter setting. If the N3IWF selection fails, or
it is not possible, the UE should select another PLMN based on the
procedure specified in clause 4.5.4.4 of TS 23.402 \[43\], and shall
attempt to select an N3IWF in this PLMN. If the UE fails to select an
N3IWF in any PLMN, the UE may attempt to select an ePDG according to the
procedure specified in clause 4.5.4.5 of TS 23.402 \[43\].

In the above procedure, when the UE attempts to construct a
Tracking/Location Area Identifier FQDN either for ePDG selection or for
N3IWF selection, the UE shall use the Tracking Area wherein the UE is
located and shall construct either:

\- an ePDG or N3IWF TAI FQDN based on the 5GS TAI, when the UE is
registered to the 5GS; or

\- an ePDG or N3IWF TAI FQDN based on the EPS TAI, when the UE is
registered to EPS.

NOTE: A UE performing both a selection for an IMS service and a
selection for a non-IMS service could get simultaneously attached to a
N3IWF and to an ePDG in the same PLMN or in different PLMNs.

#### 6.3.6.4 PLMN and non-3GPP access node Selection for emergency services

##### 6.3.6.4.1 General

UE initiates PLMN and non-3GPP access node selection for emergency
services when it detects a user request for emergency session and
determines that untrusted non-3GPP access shall be used for the
emergency access.

When the UE supports connectivity with N3IWF but does not support
connectivity with ePDG, as specified in TS 23.402 \[43\], the UE shall
perform the procedure in clause 6.3.6.4.2 for selecting an N3IWF.

When the UE supports connectivity with N3IWF, as well as with ePDG, as
specified in TS 23.402 \[43\], the UE shall perform the procedure in
clause 6.3.6.4.3 for selecting either an N3IWF or an ePDG, i.e. for
selecting a non-3GPP access node.

##### 6.3.6.4.2 Stand-alone N3IWF selection

If the UE is attached to 5GC via an N3IWF that is located in the same
country as the country in which the UE is currently located and the AMF
has previously indicated support for emergency services over non-3GPP
access as defined in clause 5.16.4.1, the UE reuses the existing N3IWF
connection for emergency services. Otherwise, the UE terminates any
existing N3IWF connection and continues as follows:

If the UE is equipped with a UICC:

\- The UE determines whether it is located in the home country or a
visited country;

\- If the UE is located in the home country, then the UE selects the
Home PLMN for emergency services and selects an N3IWF based on the
procedure defined in clause 6.3.6.2.

\- If the UE is located in a visited country, the UE performs a DNS
query using the Visited Country Emergency N3IWF FQDN, as specified in
TS 23.003 \[19\] to determine which PLMNs in the visited country support
emergency services in non-3GPP access via N3IWF; and:

\- If the DNS response contains one or more records, the UE selects a
PLMN that supports emergency services in non-3GPP access via N3IWF. Each
record in the DNS response shall contain the identity of a PLMN in the
visited country supporting emergency services in non-3GPP access via
N3IWF.

\- The UE shall consider these PLMNs based on their priorities in the
Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information (if available). If the UE
cannot select a PLMN in the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information
or if non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information is not available, the
UE shall attempt to select any PLMN in the list of PLMNs returned in the
DNS response.

\- Once the UE has selected a PLMN the UE shall select an N3IWF for the
selected PLMN as follows:

\- If non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information is available for the
selected PLMN the UE constructs the Tracking Area Identity based N3IWF
FQDN or the Operator Identifier based N3IWF FQDN as indicated in the
non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information for the selected PLMN.

\- If non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information is not available for
the selected PLMN the UE constructs the Operator Identifier based N3IWF
FQDN for the selected PLMN.

\- If the DNS response does not contain any record, or if the DNS
response contains one or more records but the UE fails to select a PLMN
that supports emergency services in non-3GPP access, or if the Emergency
Registration procedure has failed for all PLMNs supporting emergency
services in non-3GPP access, the UE notifies the user that an emergency
session cannot be established.

If the UE is not equipped with a UICC, the UE shall perform the
emergency N3IWF selection procedure above as if always in a visited
country and without using the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection
Information, i.e. the UE may construct the Operator Identifier based
N3IWF FQDN format based on a PLMN ID obtained via implementation
specific means.

When an N3IWF has been selected, the UE initiates an Emergency
Registration. If the Emergency Registration fails, the UE shall select
another PLMN supporting emergency services in non-3GPP access.

##### 6.3.6.3.3 Combined N3IWF/ePDG Selection

If the UE is attached to 5GC via an N3IWF that is located in the same
country as the country in which the UE is currently located and the AMF
has previously indicated support for emergency services over non-3GPP
access as defined in clause 5.16.4.1, the UE reuses the existing N3IWF
connection for emergency services. Otherwise, the UE terminates any
existing N3IWF connection and performs PLMN and N3IWF or ePDG selection
for emergency services.

If the UE is attached to EPC via an ePDG that has indicated support for
the emergency services and is located in the same country as the country
in which the UE is currently located, the UE reuses the existing ePDG
connection for emergency services. Otherwise, the UE terminates the
existing ePDG connection, if any, and performs PLMN and N3IWF or ePDG
selection for emergency services.

PLMN and N3IWF or ePDG selection for emergency services is performed as
follows:

If the UE is equipped with a UICC:

\- The UE determines whether it is located in the home country or a
visited country;

\- If the UE is located in the home country the UE selects the Home PLMN
for emergency services and selects an N3IWF or ePDG as follows:

\- If the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information for the HPLMN is
available the UE selects first an N3IWF or ePDG based on the Non-3GPP
Access Node type preference in the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection
Information for the HPLMN. To select an N3IWF the UE uses the N3IWF
identifier configuration (if available). If the N3IWF identifier
configuration is not available, the UE constructs the FQDN format as
indicated by the FQDN format in the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection
Information for the HPLMN. To select an ePDG the UE selects the ePDG
identified by the configured Emergency ePDG FQDN (if available). If the
configured Emergency ePDG FQDN is not available, the UE constructs
either the Tracking/Location Area Identity based Emergency ePDG FQDN or
the Operator Identifier based Emergency ePDG FQDN as indicated by the
FQDN format in the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information for the
HPLMN.

\- If the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information is not available,
the UE shall first attempt to select an N3IWF following the procedure
defined in clause 6.3.6.2 before attempting to select an ePDG. To select
an ePDG the UE selects the ePDG identified by the configured Emergency
ePDG FQDN (if available). If the configured Emergency ePDG FQDN is not
available, the UE constructs the Operator Identifier based Emergency
ePDG FQDN.

\- If the UE is located in a visited country, the UE performs a DNS
query using the Visited Country Emergency FQDN for N3IWF and using the
Visited Country Emergency FQDN for ePDG, as specified in
TS 23.003 \[19\] to determine which PLMNs in the visited country support
emergency services in non-3GPP access.

\- If the DNS responses contain one or more records, the UE selects a
PLMN that supports emergency services in non-3GPP access for the UE.
Each record in the DNS responses shall contain the identity of a PLMN in
the visited country supporting emergency services in non-3GPP access via
ePDG or N3IWF.

\- The UE shall consider these PLMNs based on their priorities in the
Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information. If the UE cannot select a
PLMN in the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information or if non-3GPP
Access Node Selection Information is not available, the UE shall attempt
to select any PLMN in the list of PLMNs returned in the DNS response.

\- Once the UE has selected a PLMN the UE shall select an N3IWF or ePDG
for the selected PLMN as follows:

\- If the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information for the PLMN is
available the UE selects first an N3IWF or ePDG based on the Non-3GPP
Access Node type preference in the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection
Information for the PLMN. To select an N3IWF the UE constructs the FQDN
format as indicated by the FQDN format in the Non-3GPP Access Node
Selection Information for the PLMN. To select an ePDG the UE constructs
either the Tracking/Location Area Identity based Emergency ePDG FQDN or
the Operator Identifier based Emergency ePDG FQDN as indicated by the
FQDN format in the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information for the
PLMN.

\- If the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection Information is not available,
the UE shall first attempt to select an N3IWF following the procedure
defined in clause 6.3.6.2 before attempting to select an ePDG. To select
an ePDG the UE constructs the Operator Identifier based Emergency ePDG
FQDN.

\- If the DNS response does not contain any record, or if the DNS
response contains one or more records but the UE fails to select a PLMN
that supports emergency services in non-3GPP access, or if the Emergency
Registration procedure has failed for all PLMNs supporting emergency
services in non-3GPP access, the UE notifies the user that emergency
session cannot be established.

If the UE is not equipped with a UICC, the UE shall perform the
emergency ePDG/N3IWF selection procedure above as if always in a visited
country and without using the Non-3GPP Access Node Selection
Information, i.e. the UE may construct the Operator Identifier FQDN for
N3IWF or ePDG based on a PLMN ID obtained via implementation specific
means.

When a N3IWF has been selected, the UE initiates an Emergency
Registration. If the Emergency Registration fails, the UE shall attempt
to select an ePDG before selecting another PLMN supporting emergency
services in non-3GPP access. When an ePDG has been selected, the UE
initiates an Emergency Registration. If the Emergency Registration
fails, the UE shall attempt to select a N3IWF before selecting another
PLMN supporting emergency services in non-3GPP access.

### 6.3.7 PCF discovery and selection

#### 6.3.7.0 General principles

Clause 6.3.7.0 describes the underlying principles for PCF selection and
discovery:

\- There may be multiple and separately addressable PCFs in a PLMN.

\- The PCF must be able to correlate the AF service session established
over N5 or Rx with the associated PDU Session (Session binding) handled
over N7.

\- It shall be possible to deploy a network so that the PCF may serve
only specific DN(s). For example, Policy Control may be enabled on a per
DNN basis.

\- Unique identification of a PDU Session in the PCF shall be possible
based on the (UE ID, DNN)-tuple, the (UE (IP or MAC) Address(es),
DNN)-tuple and the (UE ID, UE (IP or MAC) Address(es), DNN).

#### 6.3.7.1 PCF discovery and selection for a UE or a PDU Session

PCF discovery and selection functionality is implemented in AMF, SMF and
SCP, and follows the principles in clause 6.3.1. The AMF uses the PCF
services for a UE and the SMF uses the PCF services for a PDU Session.

When the NF service consumer performs discovery and selection for a UE,
the following applies:

\- The AMF may utilize the NRF to discover the candidate PCF instance(s)
for a UE. In addition, PCF information may also be locally configured in
the AMF. The AMF selects a PCF instance based on the available PCF
instances obtained from the NRF or locally configured information in the
AMF, depending on operator\'s policies.

In the non roaming case, the AMF selects a PCF instance for AM policy
association and selects the same PCF instance for UE policy association.
In the roaming case, the AMF selects a V-PCF instance for AM policy
association and selects the same V-PCF instance for UE policy
association. The following factors may be considered at PCF discovery
and selection for Access and Mobility policies and UE policies:

\- SUPI; the AMF selects a PCF instance based on the SUPI range the
UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on the results of a discovery procedure
with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI as input for PCF discovery.

\- S-NSSAI(s). In the roaming case, the AMF selects the V-PCF instance
based on the S-NSSAI(s) of the VPLMN and selects the H-PCF instance
based on the S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN.

\- PCF Set ID.

\- PCF Group ID of the UE\'s SUPI.

NOTE 1: The AMF can infer the PCF Group ID the UE\'s SUPI belongs to,
based on the results of PCF discovery procedures with NRF. The AMF
provides the PCF Group ID the SUPI belongs to to other PCF NF consumers
as described in TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- DNN replacement capability of the PCF.

\- PCF Selection Assistance Info and PCF ID(s) serving the established
PDU Sessions/PDN Connections received from UDM. In case PCF Selection
Assistance Info and PCF ID(s) are received from the UDM, the AMF selects
the same PCF instance serving the combination of DNN and S-NSSAI as
indicated by the PCF Selection Assistance Info, if multiple DNN, S-NSSAI
combinations are provided, the AMF selects the DNN,S-NSSAI using local
configuration. In case PCF ID(s) are not received, e.g. EPS interworking
is not supported, the AMF selects the PCF instance by considering other
above factors.

When the NF service consumer performs discovery and selection for a PDU
Session, the following applies:

\- The SMF may utilize the NRF to discover the candidate PCF instance(s)
for a PDU Session. In addition, PCF information may also be locally
configured in the SMF. The SMF selects a PCF instance based on the
available PCF instances obtained from the NRF or locally configured
information in the SMF, depending on operator\'s policies.

The following factors may be considered at PCF discovery and selection
for a PDU session:

a\) Local operator policies.

b\) Selected Data Network Name (DNN).

c\) S-NSSAI of the PDU Session. In the LBO roaming case, the SMF selects
the PCF instance based on the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN. In the home routed
roaming case, the H-SMF selects the H-PCF instance based on the S-NSSAI
of the HPLMN.

d\) SUPI; the SMF selects a PCF instance based on the SUPI range the
UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on the results of a discovery procedure
with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI as input for PCF discovery.

e\) PCF selected by the AMF for the UE.

f\) MA PDU Session capability of the PCF, for an MA PDU session.

g\) The PCF Group ID provided by the AMF to the SMF.

h\) PCF Set ID.

i\) Same PCF Selection Indication.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, the SMF
includes the factors b) - h), if available, in the first request.

The selected PCF instance for serving the UE and the selected PCF
instance for serving a PDU session of this UE may be the same or may be
different.

In the following scenarios, information about the PCF instance that has
been selected (i.e. the PCF ID, PCF Set Id and, if PCF Set Id is not
available, the PCF Group ID (if available)) may be forwarded to another
NF. If the NF service consumer performs discovery and selection, this NF
may use this PCF instance. If the NF service consumer performs delegated
discovery and selection, this NF may include PCF ID, PCF Set Id and, if
PCF Set Id is not available, the PCF Group ID (if available) in the
request and the SCP may use this information to select the PCF instance
(discovery may still be needed depending on what level of information is
sent by the AMF, e.g. the address of the PCF instance may not be
present):

When NF service consumer performs discovery and selection, the following
applies:

\- During AMF relocation, the target AMF may receive a PCF ID, PCF Set
Id and, if PCF Set Id is not available, the PCF Group ID (if available)
from the source AMF to enable the usage of the same PCF by the target
AMF, and the target AMF may decide based on operator policy either to
use the same PCF or select a new PCF.

\- The AMF may, based on operator policies, forward the selected PCF to
SMF instance(s) during the PDU Session Establishment procedure(s) to
enable the usage of the same PCF for the AMF and the SMF instance(s).
The SMF may decide based on operator policy either to use the same PCF
or select a new PCF. If combination of the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU
session matches one of the combination of the DNN and S-NSSAI included
in the PCF Selection Assistance info received from UDM, the AMF shall
forward Same PCF Selection Indication together with the selected PCF to
SMF instance during the PDU Session Establishment procedure. In case
that the Same PCF Selection Indication is received together with the PCF
ID, the SMF shall select the same PCF instance for SM Policy Control.

\- In the roaming case, the AMF may, based on operator policies, e.g.
roaming agreement, select the H-PCF in addition to the V-PCF for a UE by
performing the PCF discovery and selection as described above. The AMF
sends the H-PCF ID of the selected H-PCF instance to the V-PCF during
the policy association establishment procedure.

When the SMF receives a a redirection indication with PCF ID from the
PCF for the PDU session, the SMF shall terminate the current SM Policy
Control association and reselects a PCF based on the received PCF ID.
The SMF shall then establish an SM Policy Control association with the
reselected PCF.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in the SCP, the
following applies:

\- The selected PCF instance may include the PCF Id, PCF Set Id and, if
PCF Set Id is not available, the PCF Group ID (if available) in the
response to the AMF.

NOTE 2: The selected (V-)PCF instance can include the binding
indication, including the (V-)PCF ID and possibly PCF Set ID in the
response to the AMF as described in clause 6.3.1.0.

\- The AMF first establishes an AM policy association; when forwarding
the related request message the SCP discovers and selects a PCF
instance. Unless binding information is provided in the response to that
request the SCP adds the NF function producer ID it selected, i.e. PCF
ID, into the response and the AMF uses the received PCF ID and available
binding information as discovery and selection parameters for the
request to establish the UE policy association towards the SCP. The SCP
selects the (V-)PCF instance for UE policy association based on the
received discovery and selection parameters.

\- During AMF relocation, the AMF may receive a PCF ID, PCF Set Id and,
if PCF Set Id is not available, the PCF Group ID (if available) from the
source AMF to enable the usage of the same PCF instance by the AMF. The
AMF may decide based on operator policy either to use the old PCF
instance or select another PCF instance. If the AMF decides to use the
old PCF, the AMF includes the PCF ID PCF Set Id, and if PCF Set Id is
not available, the PCF Group ID (if available) as received from the
source AMF in the AM policy update request to the SCP.

\- The AMF may, based on operator policies, forward the selected PCF ID,
PCF Set Id and, if PCF Set Id is not available, the PCF Group ID (if
available) to the SMF during the PDU Session Establishment procedure to
enable the usage of the same PCF for the AMF and the SMF. The SMF may
include that information in the request in discovery and selection
parameters to the SCP. The SCP may decide based on operator policy
either to use the indicated PCF instance or select another PCF instance.

\- In the roaming case, the AMF performs discovery and selection of the
H-PCF from NRF as described in this clause. The AMF may indicate the
maximum number of H-PCF instances to be returned from NRF, i.e. H-PCF
selection at NRF. The AMF uses the received V-PCF ID and available
binding information received during the AM policy association procedure
to send the UE policy association establishment request, which also
includes the H-PCF ID, to the SCP. The SCP discovers and selects the
V-PCF. The V-PCF sends an UE policy association establishment request
towards the HPLMN, which includes the H-PCF ID as a discovery and
selection parameter to SCP.

#### 6.3.7.2 Providing policy requirements that apply to multiple UE and hence to multiple PCF

An authorized Application Function may, via the NEF, provide policy
requirements that apply to multiple UE(s) (which, for example, belong to
group of UE(s) defined by subscription or to any UE). Such policy
requirements shall apply to any existing or future PDU Sessions that
match the parameters in the AF request, and they may apply to multiple
PCF instance(s).

NOTE: Application Function influence on traffic routing described in
clause 5.6.7 is an example of such requirement.

After relevant validation of the AF request (and possible parameter
mapping), the NEF stores this request received from the AF into the
selected UDR instance as the Data Subset of the Application data. The
possible parameter mapping includes mapping UE (group) identifiers
provided by the AF to identifiers used within the 5GC, e.g. from GPSI to
SUPI and/or from External Group Identifier to Internal-Group Identifier.
Parameter mapping may also include mapping from the identifier of the
Application Function towards internal identifiers such as the DNN and/or
the S-NSSAI.

PCF(s) that need to receive AF requests that targets a DNN (and slice),
and/or a group of UEs subscribe to receive notifications from the UDR
about such AF request information. The PCF(s) can be configured (e.g. by
OAM) to subscribe to receive notification of such AF request information
from the UDR(s). The PCF(s) take(s) the received AF request information
into account when making policy decisions for existing and future
relevant PDU Sessions. In the case of existing PDU Sessions, the policy
decision of the PCF instance(s) may trigger a PCC rule(s) change from
the PCF to the SMF.

The PCF subscription to notifications of AF requests described above may
take place during PDU Session Establishment or PDU Session Modification,
when the PCF(s) receive request(s) from the SMF for policy information
related to the DNN (and slice), and/or the Internal-Group Identifier of
UEs. For the PCF(s) that have subscribed to such notifications, the
UDR(s) notify the PCF(s) of any AF request update.

The NEF associates the AF request with information allowing to later
modify or delete the AF request in the UDR; it associates the AF request
with:

\- When the AF request targets PDU Sessions established by \"any UE\":
the DNN, the slicing information target of the AF request,

\- When the request targets PDU Sessions established by UE(s) belonging
to an Internal-Group: the DNN, the slicing information and the
Internal-Group Identifier target of the application request.

\- The AF transaction identifier in the AF request.

#### 6.3.7.3 Binding an AF request targeting a UE address to the relevant PCF

Binding an AF request to the relevant PCF instance is described in
TS 23.503 \[45\].

#### 6.3.7.4 Binding an AF request targeting a UE to the relevant PCF

Binding an AF request to the relevant PCF for a UE is described in
TS 23.503 \[45\].

### 6.3.8 UDM discovery and selection

The NF consumer or the SCP performs UDM discovery to discover a UDM
instance that manages the user subscriptions.

If the NF consumer performs discovery and selection, the NF consumers
shall utilize the NRF to discover the UDM instance(s) unless UDM
information is available by other means, e.g. locally configured on NF
consumers. The UDM selection function in NF consumers selects a UDM
instance based on the available UDM instances (obtained from the NRF or
locally configured).

The UDM selection functionality is applicable to both 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access.

The UDM selection functionality in NF consumer or in SCP should consider
one of the following factors:

1\. Home Network Identifier (e.g. MNC and MCC, realm) of SUCI/SUPI,
along with the selected NID (provided by the NG-RAN) in the case of
SNPN, UE\'s Routing Indicator and optionally Home Network Public Key
identifier (e.g. in the case that Routing Indicator is not enough to
provide SUPI range granularity).

NOTE 1: The UE provides the SUCI to the AMF, which contains the Routing
Indicator and Home Network Public Key identifier as defined in
TS 23.003 \[19\] during initial registration. The AMF provides the UE\'s
Routing Indicator and optionally Home Network Public Key identifier to
other NF consumers (of UDM) as described in TS 23.502 \[3\].

NOTE 2: The usage of Home Network Public Key identifier for UDM
discovery is limited to the scenario where the NF consumers belong to
the same PLMN as AUSF.

NOTE 3: In the case of SNPN and the UE provides an IMSI type SUCI to the
AMF and the SUCI provided by UE or the SUPI derived from the SUCI is for
an SNPN served by the AMF, the AMF uses the selected NID provided by the
NG-RAN together with the selected PLMN ID (from IMSI) or the Routing
Indicator provided by the UE within the SUCI for UDM selection. In the
case of SNPN and the UE provides an NSI type SUCI to the AMF, the AMF
uses the Home Network Identifier and Routing Indicator of SUCI/SUPI for
selection of UDM.

When the UE\'s Routing Indicator is set to its default value as defined
in TS 23.003 \[19\], the UDM NF consumer can select any UDM instance
within the home network of the SUCI/SUPI.

2\. UDM Group ID of the UE\'s SUPI.

NOTE 4: The AMF can infer the UDM Group ID the UE\'s SUPI belongs to,
based on the results of UDM discovery procedures with NRF. The AMF
provides the UDM Group ID the SUPI belongs to other UDM NF consumers as
described in TS 23.502 \[3\].

3\. SUPI or Internal Group ID; the UDM NF consumer selects a UDM
instance based on the SUPI range the UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on
the results of a discovery procedure with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI or
Internal Group ID as input for UDM discovery.

4\. GPSI or External Group ID; UDM NF consumers which manage network
signalling not based on SUPI/SUCI (e.g. the NEF) select a UDM instance
based on the GPSI or External Group ID range the UE\'s GPSI or External
Group ID belongs to or based on the results of a discovery procedure
with NRF using the UE\'s GPSI or External Group ID as input for UDM
discovery.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, NF consumer
shall include one of these factors in the request towards SCP.

### 6.3.9 UDR discovery and selection

Multiple instances of UDR may be deployed, each one storing specific
data or providing service to a specific set of NF consumers as described
in clause 4.2.5. In segmented UDR deployment, different instances of UDR
store the data for different Data Sets and Data Subsets or for different
users. A UDR instance can also store application data that applies on
any UE, i.e. all subscribers of the PLMN.

If the NF service consumer performs discovery and selection, the NF
consumer shall utilize the NRF to discover the appropriate UDR
instance(s) unless UDR instance information is available by other means,
e.g. locally configured on NF consumer. The UDR selection function in NF
consumers is applicable to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The NF
consumer or the SCP shall select a UDR instance that contains relevant
information for the NF consumer, e.g. UDM/SCP selects a UDR instance
that contains subscription data, while NEF/SCP (when used to access data
for exposure) selects a UDR that contains data for exposure; or PCF/SCP
selects a UDR that contains Policy Data and/or Application Data.

The UDR selection function in UDR NF consumers considers the Data Set
Identifier of the data to be managed in UDR (see UDR service definition
in clause 5.2.12 of TS 23.502 \[3\]). Additionally, the UDR selection
function in UDR NF consumers should consider one of the following
factors when available to the UDR NF consumer when selecting a UDR that
stores the required Data Set(s) and Data Subset(s):

1\. UDR Group ID the UE\'s SUPI belongs to.

2\. SUPI; e.g. the UDR NF consumer selects a UDR instance based on the
SUPI range the UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on the results of a
discovery procedure with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI as input for UDR
discovery.

3\. GPSI or External Group ID; e.g. UDR NF consumers select a UDR
instance based on the GPSI or External Group ID range the UE\'s GPSI or
External Group ID belongs to or based on the results of a discovery
procedure with NRF using the UE\'s GPSI or External Group ID as input
for UDR discovery.

4\. UDR capability to store application data that is applicable on any
UE (i.e. all subscribers of the PLMN).

In the case of delegated discovery and selection, the NF consumer shall
include the available factors in the request towards SCP.

### 6.3.10 SMSF discovery and selection

The SMSF selection function is supported by the AMF and is used to
allocate an SMSF instance that shall manage the SMS.

If the \"SMS supported\" indication is included in the Registration
Request by the UE, the AMF checks SMS subscription from the UDM for the
UE on whether the SMS is allowed for the UE.

If the SMS is allowed and the UE Context stored in AMF includes an SMSF
address, the AMF uses the SMSF address included in UE Context (according
to Table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

If the SMS is allowed and the UE Context stored in AMF does not include
an SMSF address, the AMF discovers and selects an SMSF to serve the UE.

The SMSF selection may be based on the following methods:

\- SMSF instance(s) address(es) preconfigured in the AMF (i.e. SMSF FQDN
or IP addresses); or

\- SMSF information available in the serving PLMN if received from an
old AMF or the UDM; or

\- The AMF invokes Nnrf_NFDiscovery service operation from NRF to
discover SMSF instance as described in clause 5.2.7.3.2 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

For roaming scenario, the AMF discovers and selects an SMSF in VPLMN.

If the NF consumer performs discovery and selection via NRF, the SMSF
selection function in the NF consumer selects a SMSF instance based on
the available SMSF instances obtained from the NRF.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, the NF consumer
shall include all available factors in the request towards SCP.

### 6.3.11 CHF discovery and selection

The CHF discovery and selection function is supported by the SMF, the
AMF, the SMSF and the PCF. It is used by the SMF to select a CHF that
manages the online charging or offline charging for a PDU Session of a
subscriber. It is used by the AMF to select a CHF that manages the
online charging or offline charging for 5G connection and mobility of a
subscriber. It is used by the SMSF to select a CHF that manages the
online charging or offline charging for the SMS over NAS transactions of
a subscriber. It is used by the PCF to select a CHF that manages the
spending limits for a PDU Session of a subscriber.

For the PCF to select the CHF, the address(es) of the CHF, including the
Primary CHF address and the Secondary CHF address, may be:

\- stored in the UDR as part of the PDU Session policy control
subscription information as defined in clause 6.2.1.3 of
TS 23.503 \[45\].

\- locally configured in the PCF based on operator policies.

\- discovered using NRF as described in in clause 6.1 of
TS 32.290 \[67\].

The address(es) of the CHF shall be applicable for all services provided
by the CHF.

The CHF address(es) that a stored in the UDR or configured in the PCF
may be complemented by the associated CHF instance ID(s) and CHF set
ID(s) (see clause 6.3.1.0) stored or configured in the same location.

The CHF address(es) retrieved from the UDR and possible associated CHF
instance ID(s) and CHF set ID(s) take precendence over the locally
configured CHF address(es) and possible associated CHF instance ID(s)
and CHF set ID(s), and over the CHF address(es) discoverred by the NRF.
If no CHF address(es) is received from the UDR, the PCF selects, based
on operator policies, either the CHF addresse(es) provided by NRF, or
the locally configured CHF address(es) and possible associated CHF
instance ID(s) and CHF set ID(s).

If the PCF has a CHF set ID but no CHF instance ID associated to the CHF
address(es) in the same location, the CHF instance within the CHF set
may change. If the PCF is not able to reach the CHF address(es), it
should query the NRF for other CHF instances within the CHF set.

If the PCF received a CHF set ID and a CHF instance ID associated to the
CHF address(es) in the same location, the CHF service instance within
the CHF may change. If an PCF is not able to reach the CHF address(es),
it should query the NRF for other CHF service instances within the CHF.

To enable the SMF to select the same CHF that is selected by the PCF for
a PDU Session, the PCF provides the selected CHF address(es) and, if
available, the associated CHF instance ID(s) and/or CHF set ID(s) in the
PDU Session related policy information to the SMF as described in Table
6.4-1 of TS 23.503 \[45\] and the SMF applies them as defined in
clause 5.1.8 of TS 32.255 \[68\]. Otherwise, the SMF selection of the
CHF as defined in clause 5.1.8 of TS 32.255 \[68\] applies.

How the CHF is selected by the AMF is defined in clause 5.1.3 of
TS 32.256 \[114\].

How the CHF is selected by the SMSF is defined in clause 5.4 of
TS 32.274 \[118\].

If the NF consumer performs discovery and selection via NRF, the CHF
selection function in NF consumers selects a CHF instance based on the
available CHF instances obtained from the NRF.

The CHF selection functionality in NF consumer or in SCP should consider
one of the following factors:

1\. CHF Group ID of the UE\'s SUPI.

NOTE: The NF Consumer can infer the CHF Group ID the UE\'s SUPI belongs
to, based on the results of CHF discovery procedures with NRF.

2\. SUPI; the NF consumer selects a CHF instance based on the SUPI range
the UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on the results of a discovery
procedure with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI as input for CHF discovery.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, the NF consumer
shall include all available factors in the request towards SCP.

### 6.3.12 Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network selection

#### 6.3.12.1 General

Clause 6.3.12 specifies how a UE, which wants to establish connectivity
via trusted non-3GPP access, selects a PLMN and a trusted non-3GPP
access network (TNAN) to connect to. How the UE decides to use trusted
non-3GPP access is not specified in this document. As an example, a UE
may decide to use trusted non-3GPP access for connecting to 5GC in a
specific PLMN based on:

\- the UE implementation-specific criteria; or

\- the UE configuration, e.g. the UE may be configured to try first the
trusted non-3GPP access procedures; or

\- the UE capabilities, e.g. the UE may support only the trusted
non-3GPP access procedures; or

\- the advertised capabilities of the discovered non-3GPP access
networks, e.g. one or more available non-3GPP access networks advertise
support of trusted connectivity to 5GC in a specific PLMN.

An example deployment scenario is schematically illustrated in Figure
6.3.12.1-1 below. In this scenario, the UE has discovered five non-3GPP
access networks, which are WLAN access networks. These WLANs advertise
information about the PLMNs they interwork with, e.g. by using the ANQP
protocol, as defined in the HS2.0 specification \[85\]. Each WLAN may
support \"S2a connectivity\" and/or \"5G connectivity\" to one or more
PLMNs. Before establishing connectivity via trusted non-3GPP access, the
UE needs to select (a) a PLMN, (b) a non-3GPP access network that
provide trusted connectivity this this PLMN, and (c) a connectivity
type, i.e. either \"5G connectivity\" or \"S2a connectivity\".

Each non-3GPP access network may advertise one or more of the following
PLMN lists:

1\) A PLMN List-1, which includes PLMNs with which \"AAA connectivity\"
is supported. A non-3GPP access network supports \"AAA connectivity\"
with a PLMN when it deploys an AAA function that can connect with a 3GPP
AAA Server/Proxy in this PLMN, via an STa interface (trusted WLAN to
EPC), or via an SWa interface (untrusted WLAN to EPC); see
TS 23.402 \[43\].

2\) A PLMN List-2, which includes PLMNs with which \"S2a connectivity\"
is supported. A non-3GPP access network supports \"S2a connectivity\"
with a PLMN when it deploys a TWAG function that can connect with a PGW
in this PLMN, via an S2a interface; see clause 16 of TS 23.402 \[43\].

3\) A PLMN List-3, which includes PLMNs with which \"5G connectivity\"
is supported. A non-3GPP access network supports \"5G connectivity\"
with a PLMN when it deploys a TNGF function that can connect with an AMF
function and an UPF function in this PLMN via N2 and N3 interfaces,
respectively; see clause 4.2.8.

When the UE wants to discover the PLMN List(s) supported by a non-3GPP
access network and the non-3GPP access network supports ANQP, the UE
shall send an ANQP query to the non-3GPP access network requesting
\"3GPP Cellular Network\" information. If the non-3GPP access network
supports interworking with one or more PLMNs, the response received by
the UE includes a \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information element
containing one or more of the above three PLMN Lists. The PLMN List-1
and the PLMN List-2 are specified in TS 23.402 \[43\] and indicate
support of interworking with EPC in one or more PLMNs. The PLMN List-3
is a list used to indicate support of interworking with 5GC in one or
more PLMNs. When the non-3GPP access network does not support ANQP, how
the UE discovers the PLMN List(s) supported by the non-3GPP access
network is not defined in the present specification.

The UE determines if a non-3GPP access network supports \"trusted
connectivity\" to a specific PLMN by receiving the PLMN List-2 and the
PLMN List-3 advertised by this access network. If this PLMN is not
included in any of these lists, then the non-3GPP access network can
only support connectivity to an ePDG or N3IWF in the PLMN (i.e.
\"untrusted connectivity\").

Figure 6.3.12.1-1: Example deployment scenario for trusted Non-3GPP
access network selection

#### 6.3.12.2 Access Network Selection Procedure

The steps below specify the steps executed by the UE when the UE wants
to select and connect to a PLMN over trusted non-3GPP access. Note that
the UE executes these steps before connecting to a trusted non-3GPP
access network. This is different from the untrusted non-3GPP access
(see clause 6.3.6, \"N3IWF selection\"), where the UE first connects to
a non-3GPP access network, it obtains IP configuration and then proceeds
to PLMN selection and ePDG/N3IWF selection. In the case of trusted
non-3GPP access, the UE uses 3GPP-based authentication for connecting to
a non-3GPP access, so it must first select a PLMN and then attempt to
connect to a non-3GPP access.

Step 1: The UE constructs a list of available PLMNs, with which trusted
connectivity is supported. This list contains the PLMNs included in the
PLMN List-2 and PLMN List-3, advertised by all discovered non-3GPP
access networks. For each PLMN the supported type(s) of trusted
connectivity is also included.

a\. In the example shown in Figure 6.3.12.1-1, the list of available
PLMNs includes:

\- PLMN-a: \"S2a connectivity\", \"5G connectivity\"

\- PLMN-b: \"5G connectivity\"

\- PLMN-c: \"S2a connectivity\", \"5G connectivity\"

\- PLMN-d: \"S2a connectivity\"

Step 2: The UE selects a PLMN that is included in the list of available
PLMNs, as follows:

a\. If the UE is connected to a PLMN via 3GPP access and this PLMN is
included in the list of available PLMNs, the UE selects this PLMN. If
this PLMN is not included in the list of available PLMNs, but it is
included in the \"Non-3GPP access node selection information\" in the UE
(see clause 6.3.6.1), the UE selects this PLMN and executes the combined
ePDG/N3IWF selection procedure specified in clause 6.3.6.3.

b\. Otherwise (the UE is not connected to a PLMN via 3GPP access, or the
UE is connected to a PLMN via 3GPP access but this PLMN is neither in
the list of available PLMNs nor in the \"Non-3GPP access node selection
information\"), the UE determines the country it is located in by using
implementation specific means.

i\) If the UE determines to be located in its home country, then:

\- The UE selects the HPLMN, if included in the list of available PLMNs.
Otherwise, the UE selects an E-HPLMN (Equivalent HPLMN), if an E-HPLMN
is included in the list of available PLMNs. If the list of available
PLMNs does not include the HPLMN and does not include an E-HPLMN, the UE
stops the procedure and may attempt to connect via untrusted non-3GPP
access (i.e. it may execute the N3IWF selection procedure specified in
clause 6.3.6).

ii\) If the UE determines to be located in a visited country, then:

\- The UE determines if it is mandatory to select a PLMN in the visited
country, as follows:

\- If the UE has IP connectivity (e.g. the UE is connected via 3GPP
access), the UE sends a DNS query and receives a DNS response that
indicates if a PLMN must be selected in the visited country. The DNS
response includes also a lifetime that denotes how long the DNS response
can be cached for. The FQDN in the DNS query shall be different from the
Visited Country FQDN (see TS 23.003 \[19\]) that is used for ePDG/N3IWF
selection. The DNS response shall not include a list of PLMNs that
support trusted connectivity in the visited country, but shall only
include an indication of whether a PLMN must be selected in the visited
country or not.

\- If the UE has no IP connectivity (e.g. the UE is not connected via
3GPP access), then the UE may use a cached DNS response that was
received in the past, or may use local configuration that indicates
which visited countries mandate a PLMN selection in the visited country.

\- If the UE determines that it is not mandatory to select a PLMN in the
visited country, and the HPLMN or an E-HPLMN is included in the list of
available PLMNs, then the UE selects the HPLMN or an E-HPLMN, whichever
is included in the list of available PLMNs.

\- Otherwise, the UE selects a PLMN in the visited country by
considering, in priority order, the PLMNs, first, in the User Controlled
PLMN Selector list and, next, in the Operator Controlled PLMN Selector
list (see TS 23.122 \[17\]). The UE selects the highest priority PLMN in
a PLMN Selector list that is also included in the list of available
PLMNs;

\- If the list of available PLMNs does not include a PLMN that is also
included in a PLMN Selector list, the UE stops the procedure and may
attempt to connect via untrusted non-3GPP access.

c\. In the example shown in Figure 6.3.12.1-1, the UE may select PLMN-c,
for which \"S2a connectivity\" and \"5G connectivity\" is supported.

Step 3: The UE selects the type of trusted connectivity (\"S2a
connectivity\" or \"5G connectivity\") for connecting to the selected
PLMN, as follows:

a\. If the list of available PLMNs indicates that both \"S2a
connectivity\" and \"5G connectivity\" is supported for the selected
PLMN, then the UE shall select \"5G connectivity\" because it is the
preferred type of trusted access.

b\. Otherwise, if the list of available PLMNs indicates that only one
type of trusted connectivity (either \"S2a connectivity\" or \"5G
connectivity\") is supported for the selected PLMN, the UE selects this
type of trusted connectivity.

c\. In the example shown in Figure 6.3.12.1-1, the UE may select PLMN-c
and \"5G connectivity\". There are two non-3GPP access networks that
support \"5G connectivity\" to PLMN-c: the WLAN access network 2 and the
WLAN access network 4.

Step 4: Finally, the UE selects a non-3GPP access network to connect to,
as follows:

a\. The UE puts the available non-3GPP access networks in priority
order. For WLAN access, the UE constructs a prioritized list of WLAN
access networks by using the WLANSP rules (if provided) and the
procedure specified in clause 6.6.1.3 of TS 23.503 \[45\]. If the UE is
not provided with WLANSP rules, the UE constructs the prioritized list
of WLAN access networks by using an implementation specific procedure.
For other types of non-3GPP access, the UE may use access specific
information to construct this prioritized list.

b\. From the prioritized list of non-3GPP access networks, the UE
selects the highest priority non-3GPP access network that supports the
selected type of trusted connectivity to the selected PLMN.

c\. In the example shown in Figure 6.3.12.1-1, the UE selects either the
WLAN access network 2 or the WLAN access network 4, whichever has the
highest priority in the prioritized list of non-3GPP access networks.

d\. Over the selected non-3GPP access network, the UE starts the 5GC
registration procedure specified in clause 4.12a.2.2 of TS 23.502.

### 6.3.12a Access Network selection for devices that do not support 5GC NAS over WLAN

#### 6.3.12a.1 General

As specified in clause 4.2.8.5, devices that do not support 5GC NAS
signalling over WLAN access (referred to as \"Non-5G-Capable over WLAN\"
devices, or N5CW devices for short), may access 5GC in a PLMN via a
trusted WLAN access network that supports a TWIF function. The following
clause specifies (a) how a N5CW device selects a PLMN and (b) how it
selects a trusted WLAN access network that can provide \"5G
connectivity-without-NAS\" to the selected PLMN. This selection
procedure is called access network selection.

Each WLAN access network that provides \"5G connectivity-without-NAS\"
advertises with ANQP a list of PLMNs with which \"5G
connectivity-without-NAS\" is supported. This list is called PLMN
List-4, and is different from the PLMN List-1, PLMN List-2 and PLMN
List-3 defined in clause 6.3.12. A WLAN advertises the PLMN List-4, when
the WLAN supports a TWIF function.

#### 6.3.12a.2 Access Network Selection Procedure

The steps executed by a N5CW device for access network selection are
specified below and are very similar with the corresponding steps
executed by a UE that supports NAS; see clause 6.3.12.2.

Step 1: The N5CW device constructs a list of available PLMNs. This list
contains the PLMNs included in the PLMN List-4 advertised by all
discovered WLAN access networks.

a\. The N5CW device discovers the PLMN List-4 advertised by all
discovered WLAN access networks by sending an ANQP query to each
discovered WLAN access network. The ANQP query shall request \"3GPP
Cellular Network\" information. If a WLAN access network supports
interworking with one or more PLMNs, the ANQP response received by the
N5CW device includes a \"3GPP Cellular Network\" information element
containing one or more of the following lists: PLMN List-1, PLMN List-2,
PLMN List-3 and PLMN List-4. The PLMN List-1, PLMN List-2 and PLMN
List-3 are defined in clause 6.3.12. The PLMN List-4 includes the PLMNs
with which \"5G connectivity-without-NAS\" is supported.

Step 2: The N5CW device selects a PLMN that is included in the list of
available PLMNs as follows.

a\. If the N5CW device is connected to a PLMN via 3GPP access and this
PLMN is included in the list of available PLMNs, then the N5CW device
selects this PLMN.

b\. Otherwise (the N5CW device is not connected to a PLMN via 3GPP
access, or the N5CW device is connected to a PLMN via 3GPP access but
this PLMN is not in the list of available PLMNs):

i\) If the N5CW device determines to be located in its home country,
then:

\- The N5CW device selects the HPLMN if the N5CW device has a USIM or is
pre-configured with an HPLMN, if the HPLMN is included in the list of
available PLMNs. Otherwise, the N5CW device selects an E-HPLMN
(Equivalent HPLMN), if an E-HPLMN is included in the list of available
PLMNs. If the list of available PLMNs does not include the HPLMN and
does not include an E-HPLMN, the N5CW device stops the access network
selection procedure.

ii\) If the N5CW device determines to be located in its visited country,
then:

\- The N5CW device determines if it is mandatory to select a PLMN in the
visited country, as follows:

\- If the N5CW device has IP connectivity (e.g. it is connected via 3GPP
access), the N5CW device sends a DNS query and receives a DNS response
that indicates if a PLMN must be selected in the visited country. The
DNS response includes a lifetime that denotes how long the DNS response
can be cached.

\- If the N5CW device has no IP connectivity (e.g. it is not connected
via 3GPP access), then the N5CW device may use a cached DNS response
that was received in the past, or may use local configuration that
indicates which visited countries mandate a PLMN selection in the
visited country.

\- If the N5CW device determines that it is not mandatory to select a
PLMN in the visited country, and the HPLMN or an E-HPLMN is included in
the list of available PLMNs, then the N5CW device selects the HPLMN or
an E-HPLMN, whichever is included in the list of available PLMNs.

\- Otherwise, the N5CW device selects a PLMN in the visited country as
follows:

\- If the N5CW device has a USIM, the UE selects a PLMN in the visited
country by considering, in priority order, the PLMNs, first, in the User
Controlled PLMN Selector list and, next, in the Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector list (see TS 23.122 \[17\]).

\- If the N5CW device does not have a USIM, the N5CW device selects the
highest priority PLMN in a pre-configured list, which is also included
in the list of available PLMNs.

\- If the list of available PLMNs does not include a PLMN that is also
included in the pre-configured list(s), the N5CW device either stops the
access network selection procedure, or may select a PLMN based on its
own implementation.

Step 3: Finally, the N5CW device selects a WLAN access network (e.g. an
SSID) to connect to, as follows:

a\. The N5CW device puts the available WLAN access networks in priority
order. The N5CW device constructs this prioritized list by using the
WLANSP rules (if they have been received via 3GPP access), or any other
implementation specific means.

b\. From the prioritized list of WLAN access networks, the N5CW device
selects the highest priority WLAN access network that supports \"5G
connectivity-without-NAS\" to the PLMN selected in step 2.

After the N5CW device completes the above access network selection
procedure, the N5CW device initiates the \"Initial Registration and PDU
Session Establishment\" procedure specified in clause 4.12b.2 of
TS 23.502.

### 6.3.12b Access Network selection for 5G NSWO

In addition to the PLMN lists specified in clause 6.3.12 and in
clause 6.3.12a, a WLAN access network may also advertise the following
PLMN list:

\- A PLMN List-5, which includes PLMNs with which \"AAA connectivity to
5GC\" is supported. A WLAN access network supports \"AAA connectivity to
5GC\" in a PLMN when it deploys an AAA function that can connect with a
NSWOF in this PLMN. The NSWOF supports \"WLAN connection using 5G
credentials without 5GS registration\", as defined in clause 4.2.15.

When the UE wants to connect to a WLAN access network using the 5G NSWO
procedure defined in TS 33.501 \[29\], Annex S, the UE may retrieve the
PLMN List-5 advertised by each discovered WLAN access network and may
consider this list for selecting the WLAN access network to connect to.
For example, if the UE identifies that the HPLMN is included in the PLMN
List-5 advertised by a WLAN access network, the UE may select this WLAN
access network to connect to using the 5G NSWO procedure.

When the UE is configured by HPLMN to use 5G NSWO for connecting to WLAN
access networks using its 5G credentials (as defined in
TS 33.501 \[29\]), the UE shall attempt to select a WLAN that supports
5G NSWO and shall only use the 5G NSWO procedure for connecting to the
selected WLAN.

### 6.3.13 NWDAF discovery and selection

Multiple instances of NWDAF may be deployed in a network.

The NF consumers shall utilize the NRF to discover NWDAF instance(s)
unless NWDAF information is available by other means, e.g. locally
configured on NF consumers. NF consumers may make an additional query to
UDM, when supported, as detailed below. The NWDAF selection function in
NF consumers selects an NWDAF instance based on the available NWDAF
instances.

The NRF may return one or more candidate NWDAF instance(s) and each
candidate NWDAF instance (based on its registered profile) supports the
Analytics ID with a time that is less than or equal to the Supported
Analytics Delay.

The following factors may be considered by the NF consumer for NWDAF
selection:

\- S-NSSAI.

\- Analytics ID(s).

\- Supported service(s), possibly with their associated Analytics IDs.

\- NWDAF Serving Area information, i.e. list of TAIs for which the NWDAF
can provide analytics, trained ML models and/or data.

NOTE 1: If all services provided by one NWDAF do not support the same
Analytics ID, the NWDAF registers the Analytics IDs of the services at
the service level.

NOTE 2: Analytics ID(s) at service level take precedence over Analytics
ID(s) at NF level.

NOTE 3: For discovery of NWDAF supporting Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription
or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo services, the Analytics IDs at the NWDAF NF
profile are used.

\- (only when DCCF is hosted by NWDAF):

\- NF type of the data source.

\- NF Set ID of the data source.

NOTE 4: Can be used when the NWDAF determines that it needs to discover
another NWDAF which is responsible for co-ordinating the collection of
required data. The NWDAF does a new discovery for a target NWDAF via NRF
using NF Set ID of the data source.

NOTE 5: For discovery of NWDAF supporting Nnwdaf_DataManagement service,
at least the NWDAF Serving Area information from the NWDAF profile are
used.

NOTE 6: The presence of NF type of data source or NF set ID of the data
source denotes that the NWDAF can collect data from such NF Sets or NF
Types.

\- Supported Analytics Delay of the requested Analytics ID(s) (see
clause 6.2.6.2).

In the case of multiple instances of NWDAFs deployment, following
factors may also be considered:

\- NWDAF Capabilities:

\- Analytics aggregation capability.

\- Analytics metadata provisioning capability.

Applicable when NF consumer cannot determine a suitable NWDAF instance
based on NRF discovery response, and when NWDAF registration in UDM is
supported, as defined in clause 5.2 of TS 23.288 \[86\]: NF consumers
may query UDM (Nudm_UECM_Get service operation) for determining the ID
of the NWDAF serving the UE. The following factors may be considered by
NF consumers to select an NWDAF instance already serving a UE for an
Analytics ID:

\- SUPI.

\- Analytics ID(s).

When selecting an NWDAF for ML model provisioning, the following
additional factors may be considered by the NWDAF:

\- The ML model Filter information parameters S-NSSAI(s) and Area(s) of
Interest (see clause 5.2, TS 23.288 \[86\]) for the trained ML model(s)
per Analytics ID(s), if available.

### 6.3.14 NEF Discovery

The NF consumers may utilize the NRF to discover NEF instance(s) unless
NEF information is available by other means, e.g. locally configured in
NF consumers. The NRF provides NF profile(s) of NEF instance(s) to the
NF consumers.

The IP address(es)/port(s) of the NEF or L-NEF may be locally configured
in the AF, or the AF may discover the FQDN or IP address(es)/port(s) of
the NEF/L-NEF by performing a DNS query using the External Identifier of
an individual UE or using the External Group Identifier of a group of
UEs or using EDNS Client Subnet, or, if the AF is trusted by the
operator, the AF may utilize the NRF to discover the FQDN or IP
address(es)/port(s) of the NEF or L-NEF.

NOTE 1: When the AF discovers the FQDN or IP address(es)/port(s) of the
NEF/L-NEF by performing a DNS query, the AF can add in its DNS request
an EDNS Client Subnet option in order to help the DNS determine a local
NEF directly. The use of a DNS query for the selection of a L-NEF is
only supported for AF and not internal network functions.

NOTE 2: The EDNS Client Subnet may be derived by the AF based on factors
that are considered for NEF selection. Whether and which factors are
considered for NEF/L-NEF selection may depend on whether the AF performs
an initial NEF discovery or a NEF discovery due to L-PSA relocation.

NOTE 3: The NEF discovery and selection procedures described in this
clause are intended to be applied by NF consumers deployed within the
operator\'s domain.

The following factors may be considered for NEF selection:

\- S-NSSAI(s).

\- S-NSSAI and DNN corresponding to an untrusted AF.

\- Event ID(s) supported by an AF (see clause 6.2.6, clause 6.2.2.3 of
TS 23.288 \[86\] and clause 5.2.19 of TS 23.502 \[3\]).

\- AF Instance ID, Application Identifier.

\- External Identifier, External Group Identifier, or domain name.

\- A request for local NEF selection.

\- Location (see locality in clause 6.1.6.2.2 of TS 29.510 \[58\]).

\- (for local NEF selection) List of supported TAI.

\- (for local NEF selection) List of supported DNAI.

\- Capability of NEF to support UAS NF functionality for UUAA
procedures.

Local NEF instance(s) can be deployed close to UE access. For local NEF
selection, the location of the local NEF instance (e.g. geographical
location, data centre) may be used in conjunction with the location of
L-PSA UPF or AF.

### 6.3.15 UCMF Discovery and Selection

The AMF, MME, NEF, AF, SCEF, SCS/AS may utilize the NRF to discover UCMF
instance(s) unless UCMF information is available by other means, e.g.
locally configured in UCMF services consumers.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, the NF consumer
shall forward the request towards SCP.

### 6.3.16 SCP discovery and selection

An NF is configured with its serving SCP(s).

In a deployment where several SCPs are deployed, a message may traverse
several SCP instances until reaching its final destination. A SCP may
discover and select a next hop SCP by querying the Nnrf_NFDiscovery
Service of the NRF or it may be configured with next SCP in the message
path.

An SCP may use the SCP profile parameters in clause 6.2.6.3 as discovery
parameters in Nnrf_NFDiscovery. The parameter(s) to be used depend(s) on
network deployment. The NRF returns a list SCP Profiles as per the
provided discovery parameters.

If an SCP receives a Routing Binding Indication within a service or
notification request and decides to forward that request to a next-hop
SCP, it shall include the Routing Binding Indication in the forwarded
request.

NOTE: It is up to SCP implementation, deployment specific configuration
and operator policies as to how the SCP will use information retrieved
from the NRF to resolve the optimal route to a producer.

Based on SCP configuration, an SCP deciding to address a next-hop SCP
for a service request may then delegate the NF (instance) and/or service
(instance) selection to subsequent SCPs and provide discovery and
selection parameters to the next-hop SCP.

### 6.3.17 NSSAAF discovery and selection

In the case of NF consumer based discovery and selection, the following
applies:

\- The NF consumer (e.g. AMF, AUSF) performs NSSAAF selection to select
an NSSAAF Instance that supports authentication between the UE and the
AAA-S associated with the HPLMN or in the Credentials Holder in the case
of SNPN or in the DCS domain in the case of ON-SNPN. The NF consumer
shall utilize the NRF to discover the NSSAAF instance(s) unless NSSAAF
information is available by other means, e.g. locally configured on the
NF consumer. The NSSAAF selection function in the NF consumer selects an
NSSAAF instance based on the available NSSAAF instances (obtained from
the NRF or locally configured in the NF consumer).

In the case of SNPN, NSSAAF selection is only applicable to 3GPP access.
Otherwise, NSSAAF selection is applicable to both 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access.

The NSSAAF selection function in NSSAAF NF consumers or in SCP should
consider the following factor when it is available:

1\. Home Network Identifier (e.g. MNC and MCC, realm) of SUPI (by an NF
consumer in the Serving network).

2\. S-NSSAI of the HPLMN.

3\. SUPI or Internal Group ID; the NSSAAF NF consumer selects a NSSAAF
instance based on the SUPI range the UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on
the results of a discovery procedure with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI or
Internal Group ID as input for NSSAAF discovery.

An HPLMN deploying NSSAAF instances supporting specific S-NSSAIs and/or
sets of SUPIs (according to factors 2-3) shall also deploy NSSAAF
instance(s) that can be selected using factor 1 if they need to
interoperate with VPLMNs using only factor 1 for NSSAAF selection.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, the NSSAAF NF
consumer shall send all available factors to the SCP.

### 6.3.18 5G-EIR discovery and selection

A consumer NF of the 5G-EIR performs discovery of 5G-EIR using either
configuration or NRF as specified in clause 6.3.1. The network is
configured with the 5G-EIR to serve the PLMN of the NF consumer
requesting the 5G-EIR service, i.e. no roaming interface is defined.

The 5G-EIR selection function in NF consumers is independent of Access
Type.

### 6.3.19 DCCF discovery and selection

Multiple instances of DCCF may be deployed in a network.

The NF consumers shall utilize the NRF to discover DCCF instance(s)
unless DCCF information is available by other means, e.g. locally
configured on NF consumers. The DCCF selection function in NF consumers
selects a DCCF instance based on the available DCCF instances.

The following factors may be considered by the NF consumer for DCCF
selection:

\- DCCF Serving Area information, i.e. list of TAIs for which the DCCF
coordinates Data Sources.

\- S-NSSAI.

\- NF type of the data source.

\- NF Set ID of the data source.

NOTE: NF Set ID can be used when the NF consumer is a DCCF when the DCCF
determines that it needs to discover another DCCF which is responsible
for co-ordinating the collection of required data. The DCCF discovers a
target DCCF via NRF using NF Set ID of the data source.

### 6.3.20 ADRF discovery and selection

Multiple instances of ADRF may be deployed in a network.

The NF consumers shall utilize the NRF to discover ADRF instance(s)
unless ADRF information is available by other means, e.g. locally
configured on NF consumers. The ADRF selection function in NF consumers
selects an ADRF instance based on the available ADRF instances.

NOTE: When NF consumer is DCCF, the DCCF can have information available
already from previous registrations of ADRFs. In this case, NRF
discovery is not needed.

The following factor may be considered by the NF consumer for ADRF
selection:

\- S-NSSAI.

### 6.3.21 MFAF discovery and selection

Multiple instances of MFAF may be deployed in a network.

The MFAF selection function is supported by the DCCF. The DCCF shall
utilize the NRF to discover MFAF instance(s) unless MFAF information is
available by other means, e.g. locally configured on the DCCF. The MFAF
selection function in the DCCF selects a MFAF instance based on the
available MFAF instances.

The following factors may be considered by the DCCF for MFAF selection:

\- S-NSSAI;

\- NF Types of the Data Sources handled by the MFAF;

\- NF Set IDs of the Data Sources handled by the MFAF;

\- MFAF Serving Area information, i.e. list of TAIs for which the MFAF
may receive data from Data Sources.

### 6.3.22 NSACF discovery and selection

The NF consumers shall utilise the NRF to discover NSACF instance(s)
unless NSACF information is available by other means, e.g. locally
configured in NF consumers.

If the NSACF NF consumer is the AMF, the NSACF selection function in the
AMF selects an NSACF instance based on the available NSACF instances,
which are obtained from the NRF or locally configured in the AMF.

The following factors may be considered by the NF consumer for NSACF
selection:

\- S-NSSAI(s).

\- NSACF Serving Area information. The NSACF service area is related to
the location of the NF consumer.

NOTE: Each Serving Area is unique and unambiguously identified.

\- NSACF service capabilities:

\- Support monitoring and controlling the number of registered UEs per
network slice for the network slice that is subject to NSAC.

\- Support monitoring and controlling the number of established PDU
Sessions per network slice for the network slice that is subject to
NSAC.

In the case of delegated discovery and selection in SCP, the NSACF NF
consumer shall send all available factors to the SCP.

### 6.3.23 EASDF discovery and selection

Multiple instances of EASDF may be deployed in a network. NF consumers
mentioned in this clause are SMF(s).

The NF consumers shall utilize the NRF to discover EASDF instance(s)
unless EASDF information is available by other means, e.g. locally
configured on the NF consumer. The EASDF selection function in NF
consumers or SCP selects an EASDF instance based on the available EASDF
instances.

The following factors may be considered by the NF consumer or SCP for
EASDF selection:

\- S-NSSAI.

\- DNN.

\- the N6 IP address of the EASDF.

NOTE: The IP address of the EASDF is not used for EASDF discovery. It
can be used is to select an EASDF that is \"IP near\" to the PSA of the
PDU Session.

\- The N6 IP address of the PSA UPF.

\- Location as per NF profile.

\- DNAI (if exist).

### 6.3.24 TSCTSF Discovery

The NFs (e.g. NEF, AF and PCF) may utilize the NRF to discover TSCTSF
instance(s) unless TSCTSF information is available by other means, e.g.
locally configured in the requested NF.

The following factors may be considered for TSCTSF discovery and
selection:

\- DNN and S-NSSAI. When the NF discovers the TSCTSF for a DNN/S-NSSAI,
the NRF provides the NF with NF profile(s) of TSCTSF instance(s)
belonging to single TSCTSF Set for a given DNN/S-NSSAI. For example, the
same TSCTSF Set shall be selected by the PCF serving PDU Sessions for
this DNN and S-NSSAI to notify the TSCTSF for a PDU Session that is
potentially impacted by the (g)PTP time synchronization service.

\- GPSI or External Group Identifier. TSCTSF NF consumers (which manage
network signalling not based on SUPI/SUCI (e.g. the NEF)) select a
TSCTSF instance based on the GPSI or External Group ID range the UE\'s
GPSI or External Group ID belongs to or based on the results of a
discovery procedure with NRF using the UE\'s GPSI or External Group ID
as input for TSCTSF discovery.

\- SUPI or Internal Group ID. TSCTSF NF consumers select a TSCTSF
instance based on the SUPI range the UE\'s SUPI belongs to or based on
the results of a discovery procedure with NRF using the UE\'s SUPI or
Internal Group ID as input for TSCTSF discovery.

If the TSCTSF is locally configured in NFs, it shall be ensured that the
same TSCTSF Set is configured in all NFs (e.g. NEF, AF and PCF) for the
given DNN and S-NSSAI.

NOTE: Thus, it is assumed that there is only one TSCTSF Set for a given
DNN/S-NSSAI in this Release of the specification.

### 6.3.25 AF Discovery and Selection

The NF consumers (e.g. NWDAF) may utilize the NRF to discover AF
instance(s) in the MNO domain, i.e. trusted AF(s), unless AF information
is available by other means, e.g. locally configured in NF consumers.
The NRF provides NF profile(s) of AF instance(s) to the NF consumers.

The following factors may be considered for AF discovery and selection:

\- One or multiple combination(s) of the S-NSSAI and DNN corresponding
to an AF.

\- Supported Application Id(s).

\- Event ID(s) Supported by an AF.

\- Internal-Group Identifier.

The NF consumer (e.g. NWDAF) may select an AF instance, in the MNO
domain, considering one or multiple combination(s) of the S-NSSAI and
DNN corresponding to an AF and the EventID(s) supported by an AF to
provide the input data required for generation of analytics. The NF
consumer (e.g. NWDAF) may consider the supported Application Id(s), if
the input data is required only for those applications. The NF consumer
(e.g. NWDAF) may consider the Internal-Group Identifier supported by the
AF if the input data is required for a particular group of UEs.

### 6.3.26 NRF discovery and selection

The following mechanisms may be used for discovery of NRF service
instances and their endpoint addresses:

\- NF consumers or SCP may have all the NRF services instances and their
endpoint addresses locally configured.

\- NF consumers or SCP may have the endpoint address of a NRF discovery
service locally configured and utilize it to discover the NRF(s) and get
the NF profile(s) of the NRF(s).

\- NF consumers (e.g. v-NRF) or SCP may have endpoint addresses of the
NRF bootstrapping service and utilize it to discover the NRF service
instances and their endpoint addresses. The NRF bootstrapping service is
a version independent API, which may be especially useful over roaming
interfaces.

\- The NF consumer, e.g. AMF, may use the Nnssf_NSSelection service to
get the endpoint address of a NRF discovery service for a certain slice.

# 7 Network Function Services and descriptions

## 7.1 Network Function Service Framework

### 7.1.1 General

Service Framework functionalities include e.g. service
registration/de-registration, consumer authorization, service discovery,
and inter service communication, which include selection and message
passing. Four communication options are listed in Annex E and can all
co-exist within one and the same network.

An NF service is one type of capability exposed by an NF (NF Service
Producer) to other authorized NF (NF Service Consumer) through a
service-based interface. A Network Function may expose one or more NF
services. Following are criteria for specifying NF services:

\- NF services are derived from the system procedures that describe
end-to-end functionality, where applicable (see TS 23.502 \[3\], Annex B
drafting rules). Services may also be defined based on information flows
from other 3GPP specifications.

\- System procedures can be described by a sequence of NF service
invocations.

NF services may communicate directly between NF Service consumers and NF
Service Producers, or indirectly via an SCP. Direct and Indirect
Communication are illustrated in Figure 7.1.1-1. For more information,
see Annex E and clauses 6.3.1 and 7.1.2. Whether a NF Service Consumer
(e.g. in the case of requests or subscriptions) or NF Service Producer
(e.g. in the case of notifications) uses Direct Communication or
Indirect Communication by using an SCP is based on the local
configuration of the NF Service Consumer/NF Service Producer. An NF may
not use SCP for all its communication based on the local configuration.

NOTE: The SCP can be deployed in a distributed manner.

In Direct Communication, the NF Service consumer performs discovery of
the target NF Service producer by local configuration or via NRF. The NF
Service consumer communicates with the target NF Service producer
directly.

In Indirect Communication, the NF Service consumer communicates with the
target NF Service producer via a SCP. The NF Service consumer may be
configured to perform discovery of the target NF Service producer
directly, or delegate the discovery of the target NF Service Producer to
the SCP used for Indirect Communication. In the latter case, the SCP
uses the parameters provided by NF Service consumer to perform discovery
and/or selection of the target NF Service producer. The SCP address may
be locally configured in NF Service consumer.

![](media/image91.emf)

Figure 7.1.1-1: NF/NF service inter communication

### 7.1.2 NF Service Consumer - NF Service Producer interactions

The end-to-end interaction between two Network Functions (Consumer and
Producer) within this NF service framework follows two mechanisms,
irrespective of whether Direct Communication or Indirect Communication
is used:

\- \"Request-response\": A Control Plane NF_B (NF Service Producer) is
requested by another Control Plane NF_A (NF Service Consumer) to provide
a certain NF service, which either performs an action or provides
information or both. NF_B provides an NF service based on the request by
NF_A. In order to fulfil the request, NF_B may in turn consume NF
services from other NFs. In Request-response mechanism, communication is
one to one between two NFs (consumer and producer) and a one-time
response from the producer to a request from the consumer is expected
within a certain timeframe. The NF Service Producer may also add a
Binding Indication (see clause 6.3.1.0) in the Response, which may be
used by the NF Service Consumer to select suitable NF service producer
instance(s) for subsequent requests. For indirect communication, the NF
Service Consumer copies the Binding Indication into the Routing Binding
indication, that is included in subsequent requests, to be used by the
SCP to discover a suitable NF service producer instance(s).

![](media/image92.emf)

Figure 7.1.2-1: \"Request-response\" NF Service illustration

\- \"Subscribe-Notify\": A Control Plane NF_A (NF Service Consumer)
subscribes to NF Service offered by another Control Plane NF_B (NF
Service Producer). Multiple Control Plane NFs may subscribe to the same
Control Plane NF Service. NF_B notifies the results of this NF service
to the interested NF(s) that subscribed to this NF service. The
subscription request shall include the notification endpoint, i.e.
Notification Target Address) and a Notification Correlation ID (e.g. the
notification URL) of the NF Service Consumer to which the event
notification from the NF Service Producer should be sent to.

NOTE 1: The notification endpoint URL can contain both the notification
endpoint and the Notification Correlation ID.

The NF Service Consumer may add a Binding Indication (see
clause 6.3.1.0) in the subscribe request, which may be used by the NF
Service Producer to discover a suitable notification endpoint. For
indirect communication, the NF Service Producer copies the Binding
Indication into the Routing Binding Indication, that is included in the
response, to be used by the SCP to discover a suitable notification
target. The NF Service Producer may also add a Binding Indication (see
clause 6.3.1.0) in the subscribe response, which may be used by the NF
Service Consumer (or SCP) to select suitable NF service producer
instance(s) or NF producer service instance. In addition, the
subscription request may include notification request for periodic
updates or notification triggered through certain events (e.g. the
information requested gets changed, reaches certain threshold etc.). The
subscription for notification can be done through one of the following
ways:

\- Explicit subscription: A separate request/response exchange between
the NF Service Consumer and the NF Service Producer; or

\- Implicit subscription: The subscription for notification is included
as part of another NF service operation of the same NF Service; or

\- Default notification endpoint: Registration of a notification
endpoint for each type of notification the NF consumer is interested to
receive, as a NF service parameter with the NRF during the NF and NF
service Registration procedure as specified in clause 4.17.1 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

The NF Service Consumer may also add a Binding Indication (see
clause 6.3.1.0) in the response to the notification request, which may
be used by the NF Service Producer to discover a suitable notification
endpoint. For indirect communication, the NF Service Producer copies the
Binding Indication into the Routing Binding indication that is included
in subsequent notification requests. The binding indication is then used
by the SCP to discover a suitable notification target.

![](media/image93.emf)

Figure 7.1.2-2: \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service illustration 1

A Control Plane NF_A may also subscribe to NF Service offered by Control
Plane NF_B on behalf of Control Plane NF_C, i.e. it requests the NF
Service Producer to send the event notification to another consumer(s).
In this case, NF_A includes the notification endpoint, i.e. Notification
Target Address) and a Notification Correlation ID, of the NF_C in the
subscription request. NF_A may also additionally include the
notification endpoint and a Notification Correlation ID of NF A
associated with subscription change related Event ID(s), e.g.
Subscription Correlation ID Change, in the subscription request, so that
NF_A can receive the notification of the subscription change related
event. The NF_A may add Binding Indication (see clause 6.3.1.0) in the
subscribe request.

![](media/image94.emf)

Figure 7.1.2-3: \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service illustration 2

Routing of the messages for the NF interaction mechanisms above may be
direct, as shown in the figures 7.1.2-1 to 7.1.2-3, or indirect. In the
case of Indirect Communication, an SCP is employed by the NF service
consumer. The SCP routes messages between NF service consumers and NF
service producers based on the Routing Binding Indication if available,
and may do discovery and associated selection of the NF service producer
on behalf of a NF service consumer. Figure 7.1.2-4 shows the principle
for a request-response interaction and figure 7.1.2-5 shows an example
of a subscribe-notify interaction.

![](media/image95.emf)

Figure 7.1.2-4: Request response using Indirect Communication

![](media/image96.emf)

Figure 7.1.2-5: Subscribe-Notify using Indirect Communication

NOTE: The subscribe request and notify request can be routed by
different SCPs.

### 7.1.3 Network Function Service discovery

A Control Plane Network function (NF) within the 5G Core network may
expose its capabilities as services via its service based interface,
which can be re-used by Control Plane CN NFs.

The NF service discovery enables a CN NF or SCP to discover NF
instance(s) that provide the expected NF service(s). The NF service
discovery is implemented via the NF discovery functionality.

For more detail NF discovery refer to clause 6.3.1.

### 7.1.4 Network Function Service Authorization

NF service authorization shall ensure the NF Service Consumer is
authorized to access the NF service provided by the NF Service Provider,
according to e.g. the policy of NF, the policy from the serving
operator, the inter-operator agreement.

Service authorization information shall be configured as one of the
components in NF profile of the NF Service Producer. It shall include
the NF type (s) and NF realms/origins allowed to consume NF Service(s)
of NF Service Producer.

Due to roaming agreements and operator policies, a NF Service Consumer
shall be authorised based on UE/subscriber/roaming information and NF
type, the Service authorization may entail two steps:

\- Check whether the NF Service Consumer is permitted to discover the
requested NF Service Producer instance during the NF service discovery
procedure. This is performed on a per NF granularity by NRF.

NOTE 1: When NF discovery is performed based on local configuration, it
is assumed that locally configured NFs are authorized.

\- Check whether the NF Service Consumer is permitted to access the
requested NF Service Producer for consuming the NF service, with a
request type granularity. This is performed on a per UE, subscription or
roaming agreements granularity. This type of NF Service authorization
shall be embedded in the related NF service logic.

NOTE 2: The security of the connection between NF Service Consumer and
NF Service Producer is specified in TS 33.501 \[29\].

NOTE 3: It is expected that an NF authorization framework exists in
order to perform consumer NF authorization considering UE, subscription
or roaming agreements granularity. This authorization is assumed to be
performed without configuration of the NRF regarding UE, subscription or
roaming information.

### 7.1.5 Network Function and Network Function Service registration and de-registration

For the NRF to properly maintain the information of available NF
instances and their supported services, each NF instance informs the NRF
of the list of NF services that it supports.

NOTE: The NF informs the appropriate NRF based on configuration.

The NF instance may make this information available to NRF when the NF
instance becomes operative for the first time (registration operation)
or upon individual NF service instance activation/de-activation within
the NF instance (update operation) e.g. triggered after a scaling
operation. The NF instance while registering the list of NF services it
supports, for each NF service, may provide a notification endpoint
information for each type of notification service that the NF service is
prepared to consume, to the NRF during the NF instance registration. The
NF instance may also update or delete the NF service related parameters
(e.g. to delete the notification endpoint information). Alternatively,
another authorised entity (such as an OA&M function) may inform the NRF
on behalf of an NF instance triggered by an NF service instance
lifecycle event (register or de-registration operation depending on
instance instantiation, termination, activation, or de-activation).
Registration with the NRF includes capacity and configuration
information at time of instantiation.

The NF instance may also de-registers from the NRF when it is about to
gracefully shut down or disconnect from the network in a controlled way.
If an NF instance become unavailable or unreachable due to unplanned
errors (e.g. NF crashes or there are network issues), an authorised
entity shall de-register the NF instance with the NRF.

## 7.2 Network Function Services

### 7.2.1 General

In the context of this specification, an NF service is offering a
capability to authorised consumers.

Network Functions may offer different capabilities and thus, different
NF services to distinct consumers. Each of the NF services offered by a
Network Function shall be self-contained, reusable and use management
schemes independently of other NF services offered by the same Network
Function (e.g. for scaling, healing, etc).

The discovery of the NF instance and NF service instance is specified in
clause 6.3.1.

NOTE 1: There can be dependencies between NF services within the same
Network Function due to sharing some common resources, e.g. context
data. This does not preclude that NF services offered by a single
Network Function are managed independently of each other.

![](media/image97.emf)

Figure 7.2.1-1: Network Function and NF Service

Each NF service shall be accessible by means of an interface. An
interface may consist of one or several operations.

![](media/image98.emf)

Figure 7.2.1-2: Network Function, NF Service and NF Service Operation

System procedures, as specified in TS 23.502 \[3\] can be built by
invocation of a number of NF services. The following figure shows an
illustrative example on how a procedure can be built; it is not expected
that system procedures depict the details of the NF Services within each
Network Function.

![](media/image99.emf)

Figure 7.2.1-3: System Procedures and NF Services

## 7.3 Exposure

Network exposure is described in clause 5.20 and in clause 4.15 of
TS 23.502 \[3\].

# 8 Control and User Plane Protocol Stacks

## 8.1 General

Clause 8 specifies the overall protocol stacks between 5GS entities,
e.g. between the UE and the 5GC Network Functions, between the 5G-AN and
the 5GC Network Functions, or between the 5GC Network Functions.

## 8.2 Control Plane Protocol Stacks

### 8.2.1 Control Plane Protocol Stacks between the 5G-AN and the 5G Core: N2

#### 8.2.1.1 General

NOTE 1: N2 maps to NG-C as defined in TS 38.413 \[34\].

Following procedures are defined over N2:

\- Procedures related with N2 Interface Management and that are not
related to an individual UE, such as for Configuration or Reset of the
N2 interface. These procedures are intended to be applicable to any
access but may correspond to messages that carry some information only
on some access (such as information on the default Paging DRX used only
for 3GPP access).

\- Procedures related with an individual UE:

\- Procedures related with NAS Transport. These procedures are intended
to be applicable to any access but may correspond to messages that for
UL NAS transport carry some access dependent information such as User
Location Information (e.g. Cell-Id over 3GPP access or other kind of
User Location Information for Non-3GPP access).

\- Procedures related with UE context management. These procedures are
intended to be applicable to any access. The corresponding messages may
carry:

\- some information only on some access (such as Mobility Restriction
List used only for 3GPP access).

\- some information (related e.g. with N3 addressing and with QoS
requirements) that is to be transparently forwarded by AMF between the
5G-AN and the SMF.

\- Procedures related with resources for PDU Sessions. These procedures
are intended to be applicable to any access. They may correspond to
messages that carry information (related e.g. with N3 addressing and
with QoS requirements) that is to be transparently forwarded by AMF
between the 5G-AN and the SMF.

\- Procedures related with Hand-Over management. These procedures are
intended for 3GPP access only.

The Control Plane interface between the 5G-AN and the 5G Core supports:

\- The connection of multiple different kinds of 5G-AN (e.g. 3GPP RAN,
N3IWF for Un-trusted access to 5GC) to the 5GC via a unique Control
Plane protocol: A single NGAP protocol is used for both the 3GPP access
and non-3GPP access;

\- There is a unique N2 termination point in AMF per access for a given
UE regardless of the number (possibly zero) of PDU Sessions of the UE;

\- The decoupling between AMF and other functions such as SMF that may
need to control the services supported by 5G-AN(s) (e.g. control of the
UP resources in the 5G-AN for a PDU Session). For this purpose, NGAP may
support information that the AMF is just responsible to relay between
the 5G-AN and the SMF. The information can be referred as N2 SM
information in TS 23.502 \[3\] and this specification.

NOTE 2: The N2 SM information is exchanged between the SMF and the 5G-AN
transparently to the AMF.

**Legend:**

\- **NG Application Protocol (NG-AP):** Application Layer Protocol
between the 5G-AN node and the AMF. NG-AP is defined in
TS 38.413 \[34\].

\- **Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP):** This protocol
guarantees delivery of signalling messages between AMF and 5G-AN node
(N2). SCTP is defined in RFC 4960 \[44\].

#### 8.2.1.3 5G-AN - SMF

![](media/image101.emf)

**Legend:**

\- **N2 SM information:** This is the subset of NG-AP information that
the AMF transparently relays between the 5G-AN and the SMF, and is
included in the NG-AP messages and the N11 related messages.

Figure 8.2.1.3-1: Control Plane between the 5G-AN and the SMF

NOTE 1: From the 5G-AN perspective, there is a single termination of N2
i.e. the AMF.

NOTE 2: For the protocol stack between the AMF and the SMF, see
clause 8.2.3.

### 8.2.2 Control Plane Protocol Stacks between the UE and the 5GC

#### 8.2.2.1 General

A single N1 NAS signalling connection is used for each access to which
the UE is connected. The single N1 termination point is located in AMF.
The single N1 NAS signalling connection is used for both Registration
Management and Connection Management (RM/CM) and for SM-related messages
and procedures for a UE.

The NAS protocol on N1 comprises a NAS-MM and a NAS-SM components.

There are multiple cases of protocols between the UE and a core network
function (excluding the AMF) that need to be transported over N1 via
NAS-MM protocol. Such cases include:

\- Session Management Signalling.

\- SMS.

\- UE Policy.

\- LCS.

RM/CM NAS messages in NAS-MM and other types of NAS messages (e.g. SM),
as well as the corresponding procedures, are decoupled.

The NAS-MM supports generic capabilities:

\- NAS procedures that terminate at the AMF. This includes:

\- Handles Registration Management and Connection Management state
machines and procedures with the UE, including NAS transport; the AMF
supports following capabilities:

\- Decide whether to accept the RM/CM part of N1 signalling during the
RM/CM procedures without considering possibly combined other non NAS-MM
messages (e.g. SM) in the same NAS signalling contents;

\- Know if one NAS message should be routed to another NF (e.g. SMF), or
locally processed with the NAS routing capabilities inside during the
RM/CM procedures;

\- Provide a secure NAS signalling connection (integrity protection,
ciphering) between the UE and the AMF, including for the transport of
payload;

\- Provide access control if it applies;

\- It is possible to transmit the other type of NAS message (e.g. NAS
SM) together with an RM/CM NAS message by supporting NAS transport of
different types of payload or messages that do not terminate at the AMF,
i.e. NAS-SM, SMS, UE Policy and LCS between the UE and the AMF. This
includes:

\- Information about the Payload type;

\- Additional Information for forwarding purposes

\- The Payload (e.g. the SM message in the case of SM signalling);

\- There is a Single NAS protocol that applies on both 3GPP and non-3GPP
access. When an UE is served by a single AMF while the UE is connected
over multiple (3GPP/Non 3GPP) accesses, there is a N1 NAS signalling
connection per access.

Security of the NAS messages is provided based on the security context
established between the UE and the AMF.

and LCS.

#### 8.2.2.3 UE -- SMF

The NAS-SM supports the handling of Session Management between the UE
and the SMF.

The SM signalling message is handled, i.e. created and processed, in the
NAS-SM layer of UE and the SMF. The content of the SM signalling message
is not interpreted by the AMF.

The NAS-MM layer handles the SM signalling is as follows:

\- For transmission of SM signalling:

\- The NAS-MM layer creates a NAS-MM message, including security header,
indicating NAS transport of SM signalling, additional information for
the receiving NAS-MM to derive how and where to forward the SM
signalling message.

\- For reception of SM signalling:

\- The receiving NAS-MM processes the NAS-MM part of the message, i.e.
performs integrity check, and interprets the additional information to
derive how and where to derive the SM signalling message.

The SM message part shall include the PDU Session ID.

## 8.3 User Plane Protocol Stacks

### 8.3.1 User Plane Protocol Stack for a PDU Session

This clause illustrates the protocol stack for the User plane transport
related with a PDU Session.

![](media/image112.emf)

**Legend:**

\- **PDU layer:** This layer corresponds to the PDU carried between the
UE and the DN over the PDU Session. When the PDU Session Type is IPv4 or
IPv6 or IPv4v6, it corresponds to IPv4 packets or IPv6 packets or both
of them; When the PDU Session Type is Ethernet, it corresponds to
Ethernet frames; etc.

**- GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the user plane (GTP‑U):** This protocol
supports tunnelling user data over N3 (i.e. between the 5G-AN node and
the UPF) and N9 (i.e. between different UPFs of the 5GC) in the backbone
network, details see TS 29.281 \[75\]. GTP shall encapsulate all end
user PDUs. It provides encapsulation on a per PDU Session level. This
layer carries also the marking associated with a QoS Flow defined in
clause 5.7. This protocol is also used on N4 interface as defined in
TS 29.244 \[65\].

Figure 8.3.1-1: User Plane Protocol Stack

\- **5G-AN protocol stack**: This set of protocols/layers depends on the
AN:

\- When the 5G-AN is a 3GPP NG-RAN, these protocols/layers are defined
in TS 38.401 \[42\]. The radio protocol between the UE and the 5G-AN
node (eNodeB or gNodeB) is specified in TS 36.300 \[30\] and
TS 38.300 \[27\].

\- When the AN is an Untrusted non 3GPP access to 5GC the 5G-AN
interfaces with the 5GC at a N3IWF defined in clause 4.3.2 and the 5G-AN
protocol stack is defined in clause 8.3.2.

\- **UDP/IP:** These are the backbone network protocols.

NOTE 1: The number of UPF in the data path is not constrained by 3GPP
specifications: there may be in the data path of a PDU Session 0, 1 or
multiple UPF that do not support a PDU Session Anchor functionality for
this PDU Session.

NOTE 2: The \"non PDU Session Anchor\" UPF depicted in the
Figure 8.3.1-1 is optional.

NOTE 3: The N9 interface may be intra-PLMN or inter PLMN (in the case of
Home Routed deployment).

If there is an UL CL (Uplink Classifier) or a Branching Point (both
defined in clause 5.6.4) in the data path of a PDU Session, the UL CL or
Branching Point acts as the non PDU Session Anchor UPF of
Figure 8.3.1-1. In that case there are multiple N9 interfaces branching
out of the UL CL / Branching Point each leading to different PDU Session
anchors.

NOTE 4: Co-location of the UL CL or Branching Point with a PDU Session
Anchor is a deployment option.

########  Annex A (informative): Relationship between Service-Based Interfaces and Reference Points

Service-Based Interfaces and Reference Points are two different ways to
model interactions between architectural entities. A Reference Point is
a conceptual point at the conjunction of two non-overlapping functional
groups (see TR 21.905 \[1\]). In figure A-1 the functional groups are
equivalent to Network Functions.

A reference point can be replaced by one or more service-based
interfaces which provide equivalent functionality.

![](media/image117.emf)

Figure A-1: Example show a Reference Point replaced by two Service based
Interfaces

![](media/image118.emf)

Figure A-2: Example showing a Reference Point replaced by a single
Service based Interface

Reference points exist between two specific Network Functions. Even if
the functionality is equal on two reference points between different
Network Functions there has to be a different reference point name.
Using the service-based interface representation it is immediately
visible that it is the same service-based interface and that the
functionality is equal on each interface.

![](media/image119.emf)

A NF may expose one or more services through Service based interfaces.

########  Annex B (normative): Mapping between temporary identities

When interworking procedures with N26 are used and the UE performs idle
mode mobility from 5GC to EPC the following mapping from 5G GUTI to EPS
GUTI applies:

\- 5G \<MCC\> maps to EPS \<MCC\>

\- 5G \<MNC\> maps to EPS \<MNC\>

\- 5G \<AMF Region ID\> and 5G \<AMF Set ID\> maps to EPS \<MMEGI\> and
part of EPS \<MMEC\>

\- 5G \<AMF Pointer\> map to part of EPS \<MMEC\>

\- 5G \<5G-TMSI\> maps to EPS \<M-TMSI\>

NOTE 1: The mapping described above does not necessarily imply the same
size for the 5G GUTI and EPS GUTI fields that are mapped. The size of 5G
GUTI fields and other mapping details will be defined in
TS 23.003 \[19\].

NOTE 2: To support interworking with the legacy EPC core network entity
(i.e. when MME is not updated to support interworking with 5GS), it is
assumed that the 5G \<AMF Region ID\> and EPS \<MMEGI\> is partitioned
to avoid overlapping values in order to enable discovery of source node
(i.e. MME or AMF) without ambiguity. Once the EPS in the PLMN has been
updated to support interworking with 5GS, the full address space of the
AMF Region ID can be used for 5GS.

########  Annex C (informative): Guidelines and Principles for Compute-Storage Separation

5G System Architecture allows any NF/NF Service to store and retrieve
its unstructured data (e.g. UE contexts) into/from a Storage entity
(e.g. UDSF) as stated in clause 4.2.5 in this release of the
specification. This clause highlights some assumptions, principles
regarding NF/NF services that use this Storage entity for storing
unstructured data:

1\. It is up to the Network Function implementation to determine whether
the Storage entity is used as a Primary Storage (in which case the
corresponding context stored within the NF/NF Service is deleted after
storage in the Storage entity) or the Storage entity is used as a
Secondary Storage (in which case the corresponding context within the
NF/NF Service is stored).

2\. It is up to the NF/NF Service implementation to determine the
trigger (e.g. at the end of Registration procedure, Service Request
procedure etc) for storing unstructured data (e.g. UE contexts) in the
Storage entity but it is a good practice for NF/NF service to store
stable state in the Storage entity.

3\. Multiple NF/NF service instances may require to access the same
stored data in the Storage entity (e.g. UE context), around the same
time, then the resolution the race condition is implementation specific.

4\. In the case of AMF, all AMFs within the same AMF Set are assumed to
have access to the same unstructured data stored within the Storage
entity.

5\. AMF planned removal with UDSF (clause 5.21.2.2.1) and AMF
auto-recovery (with UDSF option in clause 5.21.2.3) assume that a
storage entity/UDSF is used either as a primary storage or secondary
storage by the AMF for storing UE contexts.

########  Annex D (informative): 5GS support for Non-Public Network deployment options

# D.1 Introduction

This annex provides guidance on how 5GS features and capabilities can be
used to support various Non-Public Network deployment options.

**Overlay network:** When UE is accessing SNPN service via NWu using
user plane established in PLMN, SNPN is the overlay network. When UE is
accessing PLMN services via NWu using user plane established in SNPN,
PLMN is the overlay network.

**Underlay network:** When UE is accessing SNPN service via NWu using
user plane established in PLMN, PLMN is the underlay network. When UE is
accessing PLMN services via NWu using user plane established in SNPN,
SNPN is the underlay network

# D.2 Support of Non-Public Network as a network slice of a PLMN

The PLMN operator can provide access to an NPN by using network slicing
mechanisms.

NOTE: Access to PLMN services can be supported in addition to PNI-NPN
services, e.g. based on different S-NSSAI/DNN for different services.

The following are some considerations in such a PNI-NPN case:

1\. The UE has subscription and credentials for the PLMN;

2\. The PLMN and NPN service provider have an agreement of where the NPN
Network Slice is to be deployed (i.e. in which TAs of the PLMN and
optionally including support for roaming PLMNs);

3\. The PLMN subscription includes support for Subscribed S-NSSAI to be
used for the NPN (see clause 5.15.3);

4\. The PLMN operator can offer possibilities for the NPN service
provider to manage the NPN Network Slice according to TS 28.533 \[79\].

5\. When the UE registers the first time to the PLMN, the PLMN can
configure the UE with URSP including NSSP associating Applications to
the NPN S-NSSAI (if the UE also is able to access other PLMN services);

6\. The PLMN can configure the UE with Configured NSSAI for the Serving
PLMN (see clause 5.15.4);

7\. The PLMN and NPN can perform a Network Slice specific authentication
and authorization using additional NPN credentials;

8\. The UE follows the logic as defined for Network Slicing, see
clause 5.15;

9\. The network selection logic, access control etc are following the
principles for PLMN selection; and

10\. The PLMN may indicate to the UE that the NPN S-NSSAI is rejected
for the RA when the UE moves out of the coverage of the NPN Network
Slice. However, limiting the availability of the NPN S-NSSAI would imply
that the NPN is not available outside of the area agreed for the NPN
S-NSSAI, e.g. resulting in the NPN PDU Sessions being terminated when
the UE moves out of the coverage of the NPN Network Slice. Similarly
access to NPN DNNs would not be available via non-NPN cells.

11\. In order to prevent access to NPNs for authorized UE(s) in the case
of network congestion/overload and if a dedicated S-NSSAI has been
allocated for an NPN, the Unified Access Control can be used using the
operator-defined access categories with access category criteria type
(as defined in TS 24.501 \[47\]) set to the S-NSSAI used for an NPN.

12\. If NPN isolation is desired, it is assumed that a dedicated S-NSSAI
is configured for the NPN and that the UE is configured to operate in
Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode a, b or c,
see clause 5.15.9, such that NG-RAN receives Requested NSSAI from the UE
and it can use the S-NSSAI for AMF selection.

# D.3 Support for access to PLMN services via Stand-alone Non-Public Network and access to Stand-alone Non Public Network services via PLMN

![](media/image121.emf)

Figure D.3-1: Access to PLMN services via Stand-alone Non-Public Network

NOTE 1: The reference architecture in Figure D.3-1 and Figure D.3-2 only
shows the network functions directly connected to the UPF or N3IWF and
other parts of the architecture are same as defined in clause 4.2.

In order to obtain access to PLMN services when the UE is camping in
NG-RAN of Stand-alone Non-Public Network, the UE obtains IP
connectivity, discovers and establishes connectivity to an N3IWF in the
PLMN.

In the Figure D.3-1, the N1 (for NPN) represents the reference point
between UE and the AMF in Stand-alone Non-Public Network. The NWu (for
PLMN) represents the reference point between the UE and the N3IWF in the
PLMN for establishing secure tunnel between UE and the N3IWF over the
Stand-alone Non-Public Network. N1 (for PLMN) represents the reference
point between UE and the AMF in PLMN.

![](media/image122.emf)

Figure D.3-2: Access to Stand-alone Non-Public Network services via PLMN

In order to obtain access to Non-Public Network services when the UE is
camping in NG-RAN of a PLMN, the UE obtains IP connectivity, discovers
and establishes connectivity to an N3IWF in the Stand-alone Non-Public
Network.

In Figure D.3-2, the N1 (for PLMN) represents the reference point
between UE and the AMF in the PLMN. The NWu (for NPN) represents the
reference point between the UE and the N3IWF in the stand-alone
Non-Public Network for establishing a secure tunnel between UE and the
N3IWF over the PLMN. The N1 (for NPN) represents the reference point
between UE and the AMF in NPN.

When using the mechanism described above to access overlay network via
underlay network, the overlay network can act as authorized 3rd party
with AF to interact with NEF in the underlay network, to use the
existing network exposure capabilities provided by the underlay network
defined in clause 4.15 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. This interaction is subject
of agreements between the overlay and the underlay network.

# D.4 Support for UE capable of simultaneously connecting to an SNPN and a PLMN

When a UE capable of simultaneously connecting to an SNPN and a PLMN is
not set to operate in SNPN access mode, the UE only performs PLMN
selection procedures as defined in clause 4.4 of TS 23.122 \[17\] using
the Uu interface for connection to the PLMN.

A UE supporting simultaneous connectivity to an SNPN and a PLMN applies
the network selection as applicable for the access and network for SNPN
and PLMN respectively. Whether the UE uses SNPN or PLMN for its services
is implementation dependent.

A UE supporting simultaneous connectivity to an SNPN and a PLMN applies
the cell (re-)selection as applicable for the access and network for
SNPN and PLMN respectively. Whether the UE uses SNPN or PLMN for its
services is implementation dependent.

# D.5 Support for keeping UE in CM-CONNECTED state in overlay network when accessing services via NWu

When UE is accessing the overlay network via the underlay network as
described in clause D.3, it is possible to keep the UE in CM-CONNECTED
state in the overlay network:

\- UE maintains at least one PDU Session in underlay network, from where
the N3IWF of the overlay network is reachable via the DN of the PDU
Session in underlay network. In this case, the UE is considered as
successfully connected to the non-3GPP access of the overlay network,
thus UE always attempts to transit to CM-CONNECTED state from CM-IDLE,
as described in NOTE 3 in clause 5.5.2.

\- IKEv2 liveness check procedure initiated either by UE or N3IWF as
defined in clause 7.8 and clause 7.9 of TS 24.502 \[48\] can be utilized
to ensure the signalling connection between UE and N3IWF is still valid
when UE stays in CM-CONNECTED state. Adjusting the time interval of the
liveness check to avoid the deletion of the IKEv2 SA due to inactivity,
on both endpoints of the SA.

\- If NAT is used, so as to avoid a timeout of the NAT entries between
the UPF in the underlay network and the N3IWF in the overlay network,
NAT-Traversal mechanisms described in RFC 7296 \[60\] and NAT-Keepalive
described in RFC 3948 \[138\] are recommended.

\- AMF in overlay network keeps the UE in CM-CONNECTED state unless UE
or N3IWF triggers the release.

\- The NG-RAN node in the underlay network can use the existing
information to decide an appropriate RRC state for the UE (e.g. whether
release a UE to RRC-Inactive).

# D.6 Support for session/service continuity between SNPN and PLMN when using N3IWF

Depending on the UE\'s radio capability and implementation, the
following existing mechanisms can be used to allow session/service
continuity between SNPN and PLMN:

\- For Single Radio UE which includes single Rx/Tx and dual Rx/single Tx
UE, seamless service continuity is not supported in this release when
the UE is moving between the 3GPP access networks of SNPN and PLMN
because of the single radio limitation. But the PDU session continuity
between SNPN and PLMN can be realized by utilizing the existing handover
procedure between non-3GPP access and 3GPP access as defined in
clause 4.9.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\], where one network is acting as non-3GPP
access of the other network.

\- For Dual Radio (Dual Rx/Dual Tx) UE, the service continuity can be
achieved by utilizing the existing handover procedure between non-3GPP
access and 3GPP access for PDU session on a single access and the
existing user plane resource addition procedure for MA PDU session,
where one network is acting as non-3GPP access of the other network

\- For PDU session on a single access, UE can register to the same 5GC
via both Uu and NWu interfaces from two networks when it is possible, by
following the procedure defined in clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] if
the registration is via Uu, or in clause 4.12.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] if
the registration is via NWu. The registration via NWu utilizes the user
plane which is established in another 5GC using another network\'s Uu
interface. For example, if UE is moving out of its SNPN 3GPP access
coverage and would like to continue its SNPN service in PLMN, UE can
register to its SNPN 5GC via PLMN\'s 3GPP access network using NWu
interface with SNPN\'s 5GC before moving out SNPN NG-RAN coverage. Upon
mobility, the existing handover procedure between non-3GPP access and
3GPP access defined in clause 4.9.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\] can be utilized.

\- For MA PDU session, if supported by UE and network, UE can register
to the same 5GC via Uu and NWu interfaces and establish MA PDU session
with ATSSS support to be anchored in the 5GC as defined in
clause 4.22.2.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\], where one network is acting as
non-3GPP access of the other network (Figure D.6-1 shows the example of
UE with MA PDU session anchored in SNPN UPF when connected to SNPN via
Uu and NWu interfaces). Upon mobility, UE can add/activate the user
plane resource to the corresponding access type basing on the procedures
defined in clause 4.22.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

# D.7 Guidance for underlay network to support QoS differentiation for User Plane IPsec Child SA

## D.7.1 Network initiated QoS

When UE is accessing an overlay network via an underlay network as
described in clause D.3, in order to ensure the underlay network to
support the QoS required by the overlay network User Plane IPsec Child
SA, the QoS differentiation mechanism based on network-initiated QoS
modification as described in clause 5.30.2.7 and clause 5.30.2.8 can be
used with the following considerations:

\- An overlay network service can have specific QoS requirement that
needs to be fulfilled by the underlay network, based on SLA between the
two networks.

\- The SLA covers selective services of the overlay network which
require QoS support in underlay network. The rest of the overlay network
traffic could be handled in best efforts basis by underlay network.

\- The SLA between the overlay network and the underlay network includes
a mapping between DSCP values of the User Plane IPsec Child SAs and the
QoS requirement of the overlay network services. The QoS requirement
includes the QoS parameters described in clause 5.7.2 that are necessary
(e.g. 5QI, ARP, etc.) during the network-initiated QoS modification in
underlay network. In order to facilitate the SLA, a guidance for details
of the mapping between DSCP values of the User Plane IPSec Child SAs and
QoS requirement of the overlay network services is described of
TS 29.513 \[133\]. The SLA also includes the N3IWF IP address of the
overlay network.

\- The mapping agreed in SLA is configured at N3IWF of the overlay
network and at the SMF/PCF of the underlay network. If a dedicated
DNN/S-NSSAI is used in the underlay network for providing access to the
N3IWF in the overlay network, the SMF/PCF in the underlay network can be
configured to enable packet detection (based on N3IWF IP address and
DSCP value) for PDU sessions associated with the dedicated DNN/S-NSSAI.

\- When UE establishes a PDU Session in underlay network, the PCF in the
underlay network determines PCC rules based on UE subscription
information and local configuration which takes into account the SLA
described above and installs the PCC rules on the SMF which generates
and installs PDR/URR on UPF. The PCC rules indicate N3IWF IP address and
the DSCP values of the User Plane IPsec Child SAs of the overlay network
which require QoS differentiation by the underlay network. So, the UPF
in the underlay network can detect packets of the User Plane IPsec Child
SAs corresponding to the overlay network services which require QoS
support by the underlay network.

\- UE registers and establishes PDU Session in the overlay network via
the User Plane connectivity established in the underlay network. When UE
is accessing a specific service of overlay network, a QoS Flow can be
created by the overlay network, then N3IWF creates dedicated User Plane
IPsec Child SA for each overlay network QoS Flow that requires underlay
network QoS support.

\- N3IWF uses the QoS profile and the Session-AMBR it receives from SMF
in overlay network along with the mapping agreed in the SLA to derive a
specific DSCP value for the User Plane IPsec Child SA. N3IWF assigns a
specific DSCP value only to one User Plane IPsec Child SA for a UE at
the same time. UE (for UL) and N3IWF (for DL) will set the DSCP marking
in the outer IP header of the User Plane IPsec Child SA accordingly.

\- The overlay network traffic between UE and N3IWF using the specific
DSCP marking will be detected by the UPF in the underlay network, based
on previous installed PDR/URR. The SMF/PCF in underlay network will be
informed when the overlay network traffic is detected. Then the PCF
installs new PCC rules on the SMF including the QoS parameters for
handling of packets corresponding to the specific User Plane IPsec Child
SA based on the N3IWF IP address and the DSCP value of the User Plane
IPsec Child SA, and the SMF generates a QoS profile that triggers the
PDU Session Modification procedure as described in clause 4.3.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. The QoS parameters are derived from the mapping agreed
in SLA based on the detected DSCP value.

## D.7.2 UE initiated QoS

When UE is accessing an overlay network via an underlay network as
described in clause D.3, if UE-initiated QoS modification in
clause 5.30.2.7 and clause 5.30.2.8 is used, the following principles
can be considered to enable consistent QoS for User Plane IPsec Child
SAs between the two networks:

\- UE registers and establishes PDU Session in the overlay network via
the User Plane connectivity established in the underlay network. When UE
is accessing a specific service of overlay network, a QoS Flow in
overlay network can be created according to clause 4.3.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]. UE receives the QoS Flow level QoS parameters (e.g.
5QI, GFBR, MFBR, as specified in TS 24.501 \[47\]) from SMF/PCF in
overlay network for the QoS Flow which is created for the specific
overlay network service.

\- N3IWF in overlay network creates dedicated User Plane IPsec Child SA
for each overlay network QoS Flow that requires underlay network QoS
support.

\- In order to ensure the traffic of the overlay network service is
handled with the desired QoS in underlay network, UE can request new QoS
Flow for the PDU session in the underlay network, by PDU Session
Modification procedure described in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]. The
requested QoS can be derived from the QoS Flow level QoS parameters
which the UE has received from the overlay network. The Packet Filter in
the QoS rule of the request includes overlay network N3IWF IP address
and SPI associated with the User Plane IPsec Child SA.

\- SMF in the underlay network notifies the PCF that the UE has
initiated resource modification, after receiving the PDU Session
Modification Request. PCF in the underlay network determines if the
request can be authorized based on UE subscription and local policy
which can take into account the SLA between overlay network and underlay
network. If the request is authorized, PCF generates new PCC rule and
installs on SMF in order to create new QoS Flow in underlay network
using the QoS Flow level QoS parameters from the overlay network. The
PDR/FAR generated refers to the N3IWF IP address and the SPI (provided
by the UE in Traffic filter in PDU Session Modification request) to
enable filtering and mapping of DL traffic towards the right PDU
Session/QoS Flow within the underlay network.

\- If SLA exists, it can include a mapping between the DSCP values of
the User Plane IPsec Child SAs and the QoS requirement of the overlay
network services. The SLA is configured at N3IWF in overlay network and
at SMF/PCF in underlay network. N3IWF can provide DSCP value to UE for
the User Plane IPsec Child SA at PDU Session Establishment
(clause 4.12.5, step 4a and 4c of TS 23.502 \[3\]). UE can include the
DSCP value as an addition in the Packet Filter by initiating the PDU
Session Modification procedure in the underlay network. PCF in the
underlay network performs QoS authorization of UE QoS request
considering the UE subscription and local configuration which takes into
account the mapping in the SLA. Details of the mapping between DSCP
values of the User Plane IPSec Child SAs and QoS requirement of the
overlay network services is described in TS 29.513 \[133\].

########  Annex E (informative): Communication models for NF/NF services interaction

# E.1 General

This annex provides a high level description of the different
communication models that NF and NF services can use to interact which
each other. Table E.1-1 summarizes the communication models, their usage
and how they relate to the usage of an SCP.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Model A - Direct communication without NRF interaction:** Neither NRF
nor SCP are used. Consumers are configured with producers\' \"NF
profiles\" and directly communicate with a producer of their choice.

**Model B - Direct communication with NRF interaction:** Consumers do
discovery by querying the NRF. Based on the discovery result, the
consumer does the selection. The consumer sends the request to the
selected producer.

**Model C - Indirect communication without delegated discovery:**
Consumers do discovery by querying the NRF. Based on discovery result,
the consumer does the selection of an NF Set or a specific NF instance
of NF set. The consumer sends the request to the SCP containing the
address of the selected service producer pointing to a NF service
instance or a set of NF service instances. In the latter case, the SCP
selects an NF Service instance. If possible, the SCP interacts with NRF
to get selection parameters such as location, capacity, etc. The SCP
routes the request to the selected NF service producer instance.

**Model D - Indirect communication with delegated discovery:** Consumers
do not do any discovery or selection. The consumer adds any necessary
discovery and selection parameters required to find a suitable producer
to the service request. The SCP uses the request address and the
discovery and selection parameters in the request message to route the
request to a suitable producer instance. The SCP can perform discovery
with an NRF and obtain a discovery result.

########  Annex F (informative): Redundant user plane paths based on multiple UEs per device

This clause describes an approach to realize multiple user plane paths
in the system based on a device having multiple UEs and specific network
deployments.

The approach assumes a RAN deployment where redundant coverage by
multiple gNBs (in the case of NR) is generally available. Upper layer
protocols, such as the IEEE 802.1 TSN (Time Sensitive Networking), can
make use of the multiple user plane paths.

The UEs belonging to the same terminal device request the establishment
of PDU Sessions that use independent RAN and CN network resources using
the mechanisms outlined below.

This deployment option has a number of preconditions:

\- The redundancy framework uses separate gNBs to achieve user plane
redundancy over the 3GPP system. It is however up to operator deployment
and configuration whether separate gNBs are available and used. If
separate gNBs are not available for a device, the redundancy framework
may still be applied to provide user plane redundancy in the rest of the
network as well as between the device and the gNB using multiple UEs.

\- Terminal devices integrate multiple UEs which can connect to
different gNBs independently.

\- RAN coverage is redundant in the target area: it is possible to
connect to multiple gNBs from the same location. To ensure that the two
UEs connect to different gNBs, the gNBs need to operate such that the
selection of gNBs can be distinct from each other (e.g. gNB frequency
allocation allows the UE to connect to multiple gNBs).

\- The core network UPF deployment is aligned with RAN deployment and
supports redundant user plane paths.

\- The underlying transport topology is aligned with the RAN and UPF
deployment and supports redundant user plane paths.

\- The physical network topology and geographical distribution of
functions also supports the redundant user plane paths to the extent
deemed necessary by the operator.

\- The operation of the redundant user plane paths is made sufficiently
independent, to the extent deemed necessary by the operator, e.g.
independent power supplies.

Figure F-1 illustrates the architecture view. UE1 and UE2 are connected
to gNB1 and gNB2, respectively and UE1 sets up a PDU Session via gNB1 to
UPF1, while UE2 sets up a PDU Session via gNB2 to UPF2. UPF1 and UPF2
connect to the same Data Network (DN), but the traffic via UPF1 and UPF2
might be routed via different user plane nodes within the DN. UPF1 and
UPF2 are controlled by SMF1 and SMF2, respectively.

![](media/image125.emf)

Figure F-1: Architecture with redundancy based on multiple UEs in the
device

The approach comprises the following main components shown as example
using NR in figure F-2.

\- **gNB selection:** The selection of different gNBs for the UEs in the
same device is realized by the concept of UE Reliability Groups for the
UEs and also for the cells of gNBs. By grouping the UEs in the device
and cells of gNBs in the network into more than one reliability group
and preferably selecting cells in the same reliability group as the UE,
it is ensured that UEs in the same device can be assigned different gNBs
for redundancy as illustrated in Figure F-2, where UE1 and the cells of
gNB1 belong to reliability group A, and UE2 and the cells of gNB2 belong
to reliability group B.

![](media/image126.emf)

Figure F-2: Reliability group-based redundancy concept in RAN

For determining the reliability grouping of a UE, one of the following
methods or a combination of them can be used:

\- It could be configured explicitly to the UE and sent in a
Registration Request message to the network using an existing parameter
(such as an S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI where the SST is URLLC; the
Reliability Group can be decided by the SD part).

\- It could also be derived from existing system parameters (e.g. SUPI,
PEI, S-NSSAI, RFSP) based on operator configuration.

The Reliability Group of each UE is represented via existing parameters
and sent from the AMF to the RAN when the RAN context is established, so
each gNB has knowledge about the reliability group of the connected UEs.

NOTE: An example realisation can be as follows: the UE\'s Allowed NSSAI
can be used as input to select the RFSP index value for the UE. The RAN
node uses the RFSP for RRM purposes and can based on local configuration
determine the UE\'s Reliability Group based on the S-NSSAI in Allowed
NSSAI and/or S-NSSAI for the PDU Session(s).

The reliability group of the RAN (cells of gNBs) entities are
pre-configured by the O&M system in RAN. It is possible for gNBs to
learn the reliability group neighbouring cells as the Xn connectivity is
set up, or the reliability group of neighbouring cells are also
configured into the gNBs.

In the case of connected mode mobility, the serving gNB prioritizes
candidate target cells that belong to different reliability group than
the UE. It follows that normally the UE is handed over only to cells in
the same reliability group. If cells in the same reliability group are
not available (UE is out of the coverage of cells of its own reliability
group or link quality is below a given threshold) the UE may be handed
over to a cell in another reliability group as well.

If the UE connects to a cell whose reliability group is different from
the UE\'s reliability group, the gNB initiates a handover to a cell in
the appropriate reliability group whenever such a suitable cell is
available.

In the case of an Idle UE, it is possible to use the existing cell
(re-)selection priority mechanism, with a priori UE config using
dedicated signalling (in the RRCConnectionRelease message during
transition from connected to idle mode) to configure the UE to reselect
the cells of the appropriate reliability group for camping in
deployments where the cell reliability groups use different sets of
frequencies.

\- **UPF selection.** UPF selection mechanisms as described in
clause 6.3.3 can be used to select different UPFs for the UEs within the
device. The selection may be based either on UE configuration or network
configuration of different DNNs leading to the same DN, or different
slices for the two UEs. It is possible to use the UE\'s Reliability
Group, described above for gNB selection, as an input to the UPF
selection. The proper operator configuration of the UPF selection can
ensure that the path of the PDU Sessions of UE1 and UE2 are independent.

\- **Control plane.** The approach can optionally apply different
control plane entities for the individual UEs within the device. This
may be achieved by using:

\- different DNNs for the individual UEs within the device to select
different SMFs,

\- or applying different slices for the individual UEs within the device
either based on UE configuration or network subscription, to select
different AMFs and/or SMFs.

########  Annex G (informative): SCP Deployment Examples

# G.1 General

This Annex provides deployment examples for the SCP but is not meant to
be an exhaustive list of deployment options for the SCP. The first
example G.1 is based on an SCP implement using (network wide) service
mesh technology, while the second example builds on SCP and 5GC
functions as independent deployment units.

# G.2 An SCP based on service mesh

## G.2.1 Introduction

This clause describes an SCP deployment based on a distributed model in
which SCP endpoints are co-located with 5GC functionality (e.g. an NF,
an NF Service, a subset thereof such as a microservice implementing part
of an NF/NF service or a superset thereof such as a group of NFs, NF
Services or microservices). This example makes no assumptions as to the
internal composition of each 5GC functionality (e.g. whether they are
internally composed of multiple elements or whether such internal
elements communicate with means other than the service mesh depicted in
this example).

In this deployment example, Service Agent(s) implementing necessary
peripheral tasks (e.g. an SCP endpoint) are co-located with 5GC
functionality, as depicted in Figure G.2.1-1. In this example, Service
Agents and 5GC functionality, although co-located, are separate
components.

![](media/image127.emf)

Figure G.2.1-1: Deployment unit: 5GC functionality and co-located
Service Agent(s) implementing peripheral tasks

In this deployment example, an SCP Service Agent, i.e. a service
communication proxy, is co-located in the same deployment unit with 5GC
functionality and provides each deployed unit (e.g. a container-based
VNFC) with indirect communication and delegated discovery.

Figure G.2.1-2 shows an overview of this deployment scenario. For
SBI-based interactions with other 5GC functionalities, a consumer (5GC
functionality A) communicates through its Service Agent via SBI. Its
Service Agent selects a target producer based on the request and routes
the request to the producer\'s (5GC functionality B) Service Agent. What
routing and selection policies a Service Agent applies for a given
request is determined by routing and selection policies pushed by the
service mesh controller. Information required by the service mesh
controller is pushed by the Service Agents to the service mesh
controller.

In this deployment, the SCP manages registration and discovery for
communication within the service mesh and it interacts with an external
NRF for service exposure and communication across service mesh
boundaries. Operator-defined policies are additionally employed to
generate the routing and selection policies to be used by the Service
Agents.

This example depicts only SBI-based communication via a service mesh,
but it does not preclude the simultaneous use of the service mesh for
protocols other than SBI supported by the service mesh or that the
depicted 5GC functionality additionally communicates via other means.

![](media/image128.emf)

Figure G.2.1-2: SCP Service mesh co-location with 5GC functionality

From a 3GPP perspective, in this deployment example a deployment unit
thus contains NF functionality and SCP functionality. Figure G.2.1-3
depicts the boundary between both 3GPP entities. In the depicted
example, two NF Services part of the same NF and each exposing an SBI
interface are deployed each in a container-based VNFC. A co-located
Service Agent provides each NF Service with indirect communication and
delegated discovery.

![](media/image129.emf)

Figure G.2.1-3: Detail of the NF-SCP boundary

## G.2.2 Communication across service mesh boundaries

It is a deployment where a single service mesh covers all functionality
within a given deployment or not. In cases of communication across the
boundaries of a service mesh, the service mesh routing the outbound
message knows neither whether the selected producer is in a service mesh
nor the internal topology of the potential service mesh where the
producer resides.

In such a deployment, as shown in Figure G.2.2.-1, after producer
selection is performed, routing policies on the outgoing service mesh
are only aware of the next hop.

Given a request sent by A, A\'s Service Agent will perform producer
selection based on the received request. If the selected producer
endpoint (e.g. D) is determined to be outside of Service Mesh 1, A\'s
Service Agent routes the request to the Egress Proxy. For a successful
routing, the Egress Proxy needs to be able to determine the next hop of
the request. In this case, this is the Ingress Proxy of Service Mesh 2.
The Ingress Proxy of Service Mesh 2 is, based on the information in the
received request and its routing policies, able to determine the route
for the request. Subsequently, D receives the request. No topology
information needs to be exchanged between Service Mesh 1 and Service
Mesh 2 besides a general routing rule towards Service Mesh 2 (e.g. a
FQDN prefix) and an Ingress Proxy destination for requests targeting
endpoints in Service Mesh 2.

![](media/image130.emf)

Figure G.2.2-1: Message routing across service mesh boundaries

# G.3 An SCP based on independent deployment units

This clause shows an overview of SCP deployment based on the 5GC
functionality and SCP being deployed in independent deployment units.

![](media/image131.emf)

Figure G.3-1: Independent deployment units for SCP and 5GC functionality

The SCP deployment unit can internally make use of microservices,
however these microservices are up to vendors implementation and can be
for example SCP agents and SCP controller as used in this example. The
SCP agents implement the http intermediaries between service consumers
and service producers. The SCP agents are controlled by the SCP
controller. Communication between SCP controller and SCP agents is via
SCP internal interface (4) and up to vendors implementation.

In this model it is a deployment choice to co-locate SCP and other 5GC
functions or not. The SCP interfaces (1), (2) and (3) are service based
interfaces. SCP itself is not a service producer itself, however acting
as http proxy it registers services on behave of the producers in NRF.
Interface (2) represents same services as (1) however using SCP proxy
addresses. Interface (3) is interfacing NRF e.g. for service
registration on behalf of the 5GC functions or service discovery.

![](media/image132.emf)

Figure G.3-2: 5GC functionality and SCP co-location choices

For SBI-based interactions with other 5GC functions, a consumer
communicates through a SCP agent via SBI (1). SCP agent selects a target
based on the request and routes the request to the target SCP agent (2).
What routing and selection policies each SCP agent applies for a given
request is determined by routing and selection policies determined by
the SCP controller using for example information provided via NRF (3) or
locally configured in the SCP controller. The routing and selection
information is provided by the SCP controller to the SCP agents via SCP
internal interface (4). Direct communication can coexist in the same
deployment based on 3GPP specified mechanisms.

![](media/image133.emf)

Figure G.3-3: Overview of SCP deployment

# G.4 An SCP deployment example based on name-based routing

## G.4.0 General Information

This clause provides a deployment example for the SCP which is based on
a name-based routing mechanism that provides IP over ICN capabilities
such as those described in Xylomenos, George, et al. \[G1\].

The scenario describes an SCP offering based on an SBA-platform to
interconnect 5GC Services (or a subset of the respective services). The
Name-based Routing mechanism, described in this deployment example, is
realized through a Path Computation Element which is the core part of
the SCP. The 5GC Services are running as microservices on
cloud/deployment units (clusters). A Service Router is the communication
node (access node/gateway) between the SCP and the 5GC Services and
resides as a single unit within a Service Deployment Cluster. The
Service Router acts as communication proxy and it is responsible for
mapping IP based messages onto ICN publication and subscriptions. The
Service Router serves multiple 5GC Service Endpoints within that
cluster. For direct communication the Service Router is not used.

5GC Functionalities communicate with the Service Router using
standardized 3GPP SBIs.

The Functionalities within the Service Deployment Cluster are
containerized Service Functions.

Depicted in Figure G.4-1, the Service Router act as SCP termination
point and offer the SBI to the respective 5GC Service Functionalities.
In this example, Service Routers and 5GC functionality, although
co-located, are separate components within the Service Deployment
Cluster. Multiple Functionalities can exist within the Service
Deployment Cluster, all served by the respective Service Router when
needed to communicate to other Service Functionalities within different
clusters.

![](media/image134.emf)

Figure G.4-1: Deployment unit: 5GC functionality and co-located Service
Agent(s) implementing peripheral tasks

In Figure G.4-1, the two depicted 5GC Service Functionalities (realized
as Network Function Service Instances) may communicate in two ways.
However, before the communication can be established between two 5GC
Functionalities, Service Registration and Service Discovery need to take
place, as described in Figure G.4.1-1. Service Registration and Service
Discovery are provided in a standardized manner using 3GPP Service Based
Interfaces.

## G.4.1 Service Registration and Service Discovery

Service registration can be done in several ways. One option is that
ready 5GC Service Functions may register themselves with their service
profile via the Nnrf interface. The registration request is forwarded to
the internal Registry as well as forwarded to the operator\'s NRF. The
internal registration is used to store the address to identifier
relationship and the Service Deployment Cluster location. The external
registration (NRF) is used to expose the Service Functionality to
Services outside the depicted SCP.

Service discovery entails Function A requesting a resolvable identifier
for Functionality B. This resolve request is received by the Service
Router which performs the task with the help of the SCP. After the
resolve is done, the 5GC Functionalities may communicate either directly
without any further interaction through the SCP, when the targeted
address is resolved within the same Service Deployment Cluster; or via
the Service Router when the Functionality resides outside of the
originator\'s Service Deployment Cluster. The Service Router then acts
as gateway towards the underlying SCP platform.

![](media/image135.emf)

Figure G.4.1-1: Registering 5GC Functionalities in the SCP

## G.4.2 Overview of Deployment Scenario

Figure G.4.2-1 shows an overview of this deployment scenario. For
SBI-based interactions with other 5GC functionalities, a consumer entity
(e.g. 5GC functionality B in the cluster on the left side) communicates
through the cluster\'s Service Router with other entities in other
clusters (e.g. 5GC Functionality D in the cluster on the right side).
The target selection is performed through the platform\'s Discovery
Service. From the client\'s perspective, the Service Router is the first
and only contact point to the SCP. The platform resolves the requested
Service identifier and aligns the results with the platform\'s policies.
The Path Computation Element calculates a path between the consumer and
the producer (e.g. the shortest path between the nodes).

########  Annex H (normative): PTP usage guidelines

# H.1 General

This Annex provides guidelines on the use of certain specific IEEE
parameters and protocol messages in the case of TSN as described in
clause 5.27.

# H.2 Signalling of ingress time for time synchronization

The ingress timestamp (TSi) of the PTP event (e.g. Sync) message is
provided from the ingress TT (NW-TT/UPF or DS-TT/UE) to the egress TT,
if supported in the PTP messages as described in clauses 5.27.1.2.2.1
and 5.27.1.2.2.2 using the Suffix field defined in clause 13.4 of
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]. The structure of the Suffix field follows the
recommendation of clause 14.3 of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\], with an
organizationId specific to 3GPP, an organizationSubType referring to an
ingress timestamp, and data field that carries the ingress timestamp
encoded as specified in clause 5.3.3 of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].
TS 24.535 \[117\] specifies the coding of the ingress timestamp in the
(g)PTP messages between a DS-TT and a NW-TT.

# H.3 Void

# H.4 Path and Link delay measurements

The procedure described in this clause is applicable if DS-TT and NW-TT
support operating as a boundary clock or as a time-aware system or as
peer to peer Transparent Clock or end to end Transparent Clock, and when
the PTP instance in 5GS is configured to operate as a time-aware system
or as a Boundary Clock or as peer to peer Transparent Clock or as end to
end Transparent Clock. Whether DS-TT/NW-TT support operating as a
boundary clock or peer to peer Transparent Clock or end to end
Transparent Clock or as a time-aware system (support of the
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] PTP profile) may be determined as described in
clause K.2.1.

PTP ports in DS-TT and NW-TT may support the following delay measurement
mechanisms:

\- Delay request-response mechanism as described in clause 11.3 of
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\];

\- Peer-to-peer delay mechanism as defined in clause 11.4 of
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\];

\- Common Mean Link Delay Service.

Depending on the measurement mechanisms supported by DS-TT and NW-TT as
well as the configured clock mode of 5GS, the PTP ports in DS-TT and
NW-TT are configured as follows:

\- PTP ports configured to operate as a time-aware system according to
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\] may be configured to use the peer-to-peer delay
mechanism or Common Mean Link Delay Service;

\- PTP ports configured to operate as a Boundary Clock according to
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] may be configured to use the delay
request-response mechanism, the peer-to-peer delay mechanism or Common
Mean Link Delay Service.

\- PTP ports in 5GS configured to operate as a peer-to-peer Transparent
Clock according to IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] shall use the peer-to-peer
delay mechanism.

\- PTP ports in 5GS configured to operate as an end-to-end Transparent
Clock according to IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] do not actively participate in
path and link measurements mechanisms but shall calculate and add
residence time and delay asymmetry information to PTP messages as
defined in clause 10.2.2 of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

If DS-TT and NW-TT support operating as an end-to-end Transparent Clock,
then the residence time for one-step operation as an end-to-end
Transparent Clock for the path and link measurements is calculated as
follows:

\- Upon reception of a PTP Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdely_Resp message from
the upstream PTP instance, the ingress TT (i.e. NW-TT or DS-TT) makes an
ingress timestamping (TSi) for the message.

\- The ingress timestamp is conveyed to the egress TT via the PDU
Session as described in clause H.2.

\- The PTP port in the egress TT then creates egress timestamping (TSe)
for the PTP message for external PTP network. The difference between TSi
and TSe is considered as the calculated residence time spent within the
5G system for this PTP message expressed in 5GS time. If needed, the PTP
port in the egress TT convert the calculated resident time in 5GS into
the residence time expressed in PTP GM time e.g. by means of the factor
as specified in Equation (6) of clause 12.2.2 of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

\- The PTP port in the egress TT modifies the payload of the PTP
Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdelay_Resp message that it sends towards the
downstream PTP instance as follows:

\- Adds the calculated residence time to the correction field.

\- Removes Suffix field that contains TSi.

If DS-TT and NW-TT support operating as an end-to-end Transparent Clock,
then the residence time for two-step operation as an end-to-end
Transparent Clock for the path and link measurements is calculated as
follows:

\- Upon reception of a PTP Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdelay_Resp message from
the upstream PTP instance, the ingress TT (i.e. NW-TT or DS-TT) makes an
ingress timestamping (TSi) for the message.

\- If the ingress TT receives a Pdelay_Resp message with the twoStepFlag
set to FALSE, then the ingress TT modifies the twoStepFlag to TRUE and
creates a PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message.

\- The ingress timestamp is conveyed to the egress TT via the PDU
Session as described in clause H.2.

\- The PTP port in the egress TT then creates egress timestamping (TSe)
for the PTP message for external PTP network. The difference between TSi
and TSe is considered as the calculated residence time spent within the
5G system for this PTP message expressed in 5GS time. If needed, the PTP
port in the egress TT converts the calculated residence time in 5GS into
the residence time expressed in PTP GM time, e.g. by means of the factor
as specified in Equation (6) of clause 12.2.2 of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].
The egress TT then stores the calculated residence time expressed in PTP
GM time and removes Suffix field that contains TSi before sending the
PTP Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdelay_Resp message towards the downstream PTP
instance.

\- Upon reception of the PTP Delay_Resp message associated with the PTP
Delay_Req, the egress TT for the PTP Delay_Req message (i.e. the ingress
TT for the PTP Delay_Resp message) modifies the payload of the PTP
Delay_Resp message that it sends towards the ingress TT of the PTP
Delay_Req message (i.e. egress TT for the PTP Delay_Resp message) as
follows:

\- Adds the (previously stored) calculated residence time to the
correction field.

\- Upon reception (or local creation) of the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up
message associated with the previously received PTP Pdelay_Resp message,
the ingress TT for the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message modifies the
payload of the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message that it sends towards
the egress TT for the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message as follows:

\- Adds the (previously stored) calculated residence time of the
associated PTP Pdelay_Req message to the correction field.

\- Upon reception of the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message associated
with the PTP Pdelay_Resp, the egress TT for PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up
message modifies the payload of the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message
that it sends towards the downstream PTP instance as follows:

\- Adds the (previously stored) calculated residence time of the
associated PTP Pdelay_Resp messages to the correction field.

########  Annex I (normative): TSN usage guidelines

# I.1 Determination of traffic pattern information

As described in clause 5.27.2, the calculation of the TSCAI relies upon
mapping of information for the TSN stream(s) based upon certain IEEE
standard information.

Additional traffic pattern parameters such as maximum burst size and
maximum flow bitrate can be mapped to MDBV and GFBR.

The traffic pattern parameter determination based on PSFP (IEEE
Std 802.1Q \[98\]), when available, is as follows:

\- Periodicity of a TSN stream is set equal to PSFPAdminCycleTime if
there is only one PSFPGateControlEntry with a PSFPgateStatesValue set to
Open in the PSFPAdminControlList. If there is more than one
PSFPGateControlEntry with a PSFPgateStatesValue set to Open in the
PSFPAdminControlList, then the Periodicity of the TSN Stream is set
equal to sum of the timeIntervalValues from the first gate open instance
to a next gate open instance in the PSFPAdminControlList. For aggregated
TSN streams with same periodicity and compatible Burst Arrival Times,
the periodicity of the aggregated flow of these TSN Streams is set equal
to PSFPAdminCycleTime received from CNC for one of the TSN streams that
are aggregated.

NOTE 1: Given that only TSN streams that have the same periodicity and
compatible Burst Arrival Time can be aggregated, the PSFPAdminCycleTime
for those TSN streams is assumed to be the same.

\- Burst Arrival time of a TSN stream at the ingress port is determined
based on the following conditions:

\- The Burst Arrival Time of a TSN Stream should be set to
PSFPAdminBaseTime plus the sum of the timeIntervalValues for which the
PSFPgateStatesValue is Closed in the PSFP AdminControlList until the
first gate open time (i.e. until PSFPgateStatesValue set to Open is
found). If the PSFPgateStatesValue is Open for the first
timeIntervalValue, then the Burst Arrival time is set to
PSFPAdminBaseTime. For aggregated TSN streams, the arrival time is
calculated similarly, but using the time interval to the first
PSFPgateStatesValue that is Open from the aggregated TSN streams.

\- Burst Size of a TSN stream at the ingress port (which is useful to
map to MDBV) is determined based on the following conditions:

\- The Burst Size may be determined from TSN Stream gate control
operations in the PSFPAdminControlList. If in the PSFPAdminControlList,
IntervalOctetMax is provided for a PSFPGateControlEntry with an \"open\"
PSFPgateStatesValue, the Burst Size is set to the IntervalOctetMax for
that control list entry. If IntervalOctetMax is not provided, the Burst
Size is set to the timeIntervalValue (converted from ns to s) of the
PSFPGateControlEntry with an \"open\" PSFPgateStatesValue multiplied by
the port bitrate.

\- When multiple compatible TSN Streams are aggregated, the Burst Size
is set to the sum of the Burst Sizes for each TSN stream as determined
above.

\- Maximum Flow Bitrate of a TSN stream (which is useful to map to GBR)
is determined as follows:

\- The Maximum Flow Bitrate of a TSN Stream is equal to the summation of
all timeIntervalValue (converted from ns to s) with PSFPgateStatesValue
= Open, multiplied by the bitrate of the corresponding port, and divided
by PSFPAdminCycleTime. For aggregated TSN streams, the same calculation
is performed over the burst of aggregated streams (calculated using
superposition, i.e. timeIntervalValue with PSFPgateStatesValue = Open of
every stream is summed up, as they are assumed to have same periodicity,
compatible Burst arrival time, and same traffic class if they are to be
aggregated.

When CNC configures the PSFP information to the TSN AF, the TSN AF may
use local information (e.g. local configuration) to map the PSFP
information to an ingress port and/or egress port of the 5GS bridge.

NOTE 2: As an example, for the local configuration, the PSFP can use
either the destination MAC address and VLAN identifier, or the source
MAC address and VLAN identifier for stream identification. The TSN AF is
pre-configured with either the MAC address of Ethernet hosts behind a
given DS-TT port (identified by the DS-TT port MAC address), or the VLAN
identifier used over a given DS-TT port, or both. When the TSN AF
determines that one of the known Ethernet host\'s MAC address appears as
a source or destination MAC address, it can identify that the ingress or
egress port is the associated DS-TT port.

########  Annex J (informative): Link MTU considerations

According to clause 5.6.10.4 networks can provide link MTU size for UEs.
A purpose of the link MTU size provisioning is to limit the size of the
packets sent by the UE to avoid packet fragmentation in the backbone
network between the UE and the UPF acting as PSA (and/or across the N6
reference point). Fragmentation within the backbone network creates a
significant overhead. Therefore operators might desire to avoid it. This
Annex presents an overhead calculation that can be used by operators to
set the link MTU size provided by the network. A UE might not employ the
provided link MTU size, e.g. when the MT and TE are separated, as
discussed in clause 5.6.10.4. Therefore, providing an MTU size does not
guarantee that there will be no packets larger than the provided value.
However, if UEs follow the provided link MTU value operators will
benefit from reduced transmission overhead within backbone networks.

One of the worst-case scenarios is when GTP packets, e.g. between a
NG-RAN node and the 5GC, are transferred over IPSec tunnel in an IPv6
deployment. In that case the user packet first encapsulated in a GTP
tunnel which results in the following overhead:

\- IPv6 header, which is 40 octets;

\- UDP overhead, which is 8 octets;

\- Extended GTP-U header, which is 16 octets.

NOTE 1: The sending of a Reflective QoS Indicator within a GTP-U header
extension, or the use of Long PDCP PDU numbers at handover will further
increase the GTP-U header size (see TS 29.281 \[75\] and
TS 38.415 \[116\]).

In this scenario the GTP packet then further encapsulated into an IPSec
tunnel. The actual IPSec tunnel overhead depends on the used encryption
and integrity protection algorithms. TS 33.210 \[115\] mandates the
support of AES-GMAC with a key length of 128 bits and the use of
HMAC_SHA-1 for integrity protection. Therefore, the overhead with those
algorithms is calculated as:

\- IPv6 header, which is 40 octets;

\- IPSec Security Parameter Index and Sequence Number overhead, which is
4+4 octets;

\- Initialization Vector for the encryption algorithm, which is 16
octets;

\- Padding to make the size of the encrypted payload a multiple of 16;

\- Padding Length and Next Header octets (2 octets);

\- Integrity Check Value, which is 12 octets.

In order to make the user packet size as large as possible a padding of
0 octet is assumed. With this zero padding assumption the total overhead
is 142 octets, which results a maximum user packet size of transport MTU
minus 142 octets. Note that in the case of transport MTU=1500, this user
packet size will result in a 1424 octets payload length to be ciphered,
which is a multiple of 16, thus the assumption that no padding is needed
is correct (see Figure J.1). Similar calculations can be done for
networks with transport that supports larger MTU sizes.

![](media/image137.emf)

Figure J-1: Overhead calculation for transport MTU=1500 octet

The link MTU value that can prevent fragmentation in the backbone
network between the UE and the UPF acting as PSA depends on the actual
deployment. Based on the above calculation a link MTU value of 1358 is
small enough in most of the network deployments. However for network
deployments where the transport uniformly supports for example ethernet
jumbo frames, transport MTU\<=9216 octets can provide a much larger UE
MTU and hence more efficient transfer of user data. One example of when
it can be ensured that all links support larger packet sizes, is when
the UE uses a specific Network Slice with a limited coverage area.

Note that using a link MTU value smaller than necessary would decrease
the efficiency in the network. Moreover, a UE might also apply some
tunnelling (e.g. VPN). It is desirable to use a link MTU size that
assures at least MTU minus 220 octets within the UE tunnel to avoid the
fragmentation of the user packets within the tunnel applied in the UE.
In the case transport MTU is 1500 octets, this results a link MTU of
1280 octets (for the transport), which is the minimum MTU size in the
case of IPv6.

The above methodology can be modified for calculation of the UE\'s link
MTU when a UPF has MTU limits on the N6 reference point and is offering
a PDU Session with Ethernet or Unstructured PDU Session type between the
UPF and the UE.

######## Annex K (normative): Port and user plane node management information exchange

# K.1 Standardized port and user plane node management information

Editor\'s note: Table 5.28.3.1-1 and Table 5.28.3.1-2 will moved here
once the tables are stable.

# K.2 Port and user plane node management information exchange for time synchronization

## K.2.1 Capability exchange

DS-TT and NW-TT indicate time synchronization information they support
inside the Port management capabilities (see Table 5.28.3.1-1).

TSN AF and TSCTSF may determine the PTP functionalities supported by
DS-TT and NW-TT by retrieving the following port management information
or user plane node management information, respectively:

\- Supported PTP instance types;

\- Supported transport types;

\- Supported PTP delay mechanisms;

\- Grandmaster capability;

\- Supported PTP profiles;

\- Number of supported PTP instances.

NOTE: If NW-TT or DS-TT do not indicate support for any of the PTP
profiles and PTP instance types, then TSN AF or TSCTSF assume that the
NW-TT or DS-TT only support acting as a PTP Relay instance with the gPTP
GM connected on N6.

If DS-TT and NW-TT support the PTP Relay instance type as defined by
IEEE 802.1AS \[104\] then DS-TT and NW-TT shall include the IEEE 
802.1AS \[104\] PTP profile in the \"Supported PTP profiles\" in PMIC
and UMIC, respectively.

The TSN AF or TSCTSF may retrieve the \"Number of supported PTP
instances\" from NW-TT via UMIC and from DS-TT via PMIC.

## K.2.2 PTP Instance configuration

### K.2.2.1 General

Based on input received from external applications (CNC in case of TSN
AF or any AF in case of TSCTSF), TSN AF or TSCTSF may configure PTP
instances (identified by PTP Instance ID) in a DS-TT or NW-TT by sending
port management information (PMIC, see Table 5.28.3.1-1) and user plane
node management information (UMIC, see Table 5.28.3.1-2) to DS-TT or
NW-TT as described below:

\- use PMIC \"PTP instance specification\" for configuring DS-TT(s) for
PTP instance data sets common for all PTP ports (i.e. defaultDS and
TimePropertiesDS), and PTP instance data sets specific for each PTP port
(i.e. portDS data set);

\- use UMIC \"PTP instance specification\" for configuring NW-TT for PTP
instance data sets common for all PTP ports;

\- use PMIC \"PTP instance specification\" for configuring NW-TT for PTP
instance data sets specific for each PTP port;

\- use UMIC \"Time synchronization information for DS-TT ports\" for
configuring NW-TT for PTP instance data sets specific for each PTP port
for the PTP ports in DS-TT(s).

TSN AF or TSCTSF may also configure PTP instances for DS-TT ports in
NW-TT by sending UMIC (see Table 5.28.3.1-2) to NW-TT to enable NW-TT to
operate as a grandmaster on behalf of DS-TT (see clause K.2.2.4 for more
details).

For each PTP instance the TSN AF or TSCTSF may provide individual PTP
configuration parameters or may provide a PTP profile ID to DS-TT or
NW-TT. The DS-TT and NW-TT use the default values as defined in the
corresponding PTP Profile, if individual PTP configuration parameters
that are covered by the PTP profile are not provided.

NOTE 1: Even if PTP profiles are used to configure DS-TT or NW-TT,
individual PTP parameters can still be configured in addition, e.g.
domain numbers, transport to use, etc.

To configure DS-TT and NW-TT to operate as a PTP relay instance, TSN AF
or TSCTSF shall set the PTP profile (see Table 5.28.3.1-1) to
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\].

DS-TT may operate as a PTP relay instance with the gPTP GM connected on
N6 until the first PTP instance is configured in the DS-TT by TSN AF or
TSCTSF.

To initialize a PTP instance in 5GS, TSN AF or TSCTSF creates a new PTP
instance in NW-TT by assigning a new PTP Instance ID and indicating it
to the NW-TT in \"PTP instance specification\" in UMIC and PMIC(s) for
each NW-TT port that is part of the PTP instance. TSN AF or TSCTSF then
retrieves the \"defaultDS.clockIdentity\" of the PTP instance in NW-TT
via UMIC. NW-TT ensures that the clockIdentity in defaultDS in UMIC
matches with the clockIdentity in the portDS.portIdentity in PMIC(s) for
a particular PTP Instance ID.

To add a DS-TT port into an existent PTP instance in 5GS, the TSN AF or
TSCTSF indicates the PTP Instance ID (to which the DS-TT port is being
added) to the DS-TT in \"PTP instance specification\" in PMIC, and
indicating the PTP Instance ID to the NW-TT in \"Time synchronization
information for DS-TT ports\" in UMIC for the corresponding DS-TT port.

For a particular PTP instance in NW-TT, the same PTP Instance ID shall
be used in \"PTP instance specification\" in PMIC, in \"PTP instance
specification\" in UMIC, and in \"Time synchronization information for
DS-TT ports\" in UMIC.

NOTE 2: The TSN AF or TSCTSF creates a PTP Instance in the NW-TT or
DS-TT by using the \"Set parameter\" operation code as described in
TS 24.539 \[139\]. The NW-TT or DS-TT determines that this \"Set
parameter\" operation creates a new PTP Instance based on the PTP
Instance ID that does not correspond to any of the configured PTP
Instances in the \"PTP instance specification\" and \"Time
synchronization information for DS-TT ports\" (for NW-TT) or in the
\"PTP instance specification\" (for DS-TT).

The TSN AF or TSCTSF then initializes the PTP instance in the DS-TT by
setting the applicable PTP instance data sets common for all PTP ports
(i.e. defaultDS and TimePropertiesDS),
(including\"defaultDS.clockIdentity\") via \"PTP instance
specification\" in PMIC to the same value as retrieved from the NW-TT
via \"PTP instance specification\" in UMIC. The TSN AF or TSCTSF also
enables the PTP instance by setting the defaultDS.instanceEnable = TRUE
to DS-TT via PMIC and to NW-TT via UMIC (if applicable). The TSN AF or
TSCTSF can initialize any number of PTP instances:

a\) among the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT that are part of the same set of PTP
instances in 5GS; up to the maximum number of supported PTP instances by
the NW-TT or DS-TT that supports the lowest number of supported PTP
instances; and

b\) in the NW-TT; up to the maximum number of supported PTP instances by
the NW-TT.

NOTE 3: How the TSN AF or TSCTSF assign NW-TT port(s) of one NW-TT to
different PTP instances is up to implementation.

To remove a DS-TT port from a PTP instance in 5GS, the TSN AF or TSCTSF
deletes the PTP instance in DS-TT using PMIC and in NW-TT using UMIC as
specified in TS 24.539 \[139\]. To remove a NW-TT port from a PTP
instance in 5GS, the TSN AF or TSCTSF deletes the PTP instance in NW-TT
using PMIC as specified in TS 24.539 \[139\]. If a PTP instance in 5GS
is no more needed the TSN AF or TSCTSF may delete the PTP instance in
NW-TT using UMIC as specified in TS 24.539 \[139\].

### K.2.2.2 Configuration for Sync and Announce reception timeouts

The NW-TT shall be able to determine the timeout of the reception of
(g)PTP Announce (when the 5GS operates as a time-aware system or
Boundary Clock) and gPTP Sync messages (when the 5GS operates as
time-aware system). To enable this, the TSCTSF or TSN AF shall configure
the NW-TT for the following information via PMIC for each PTP port in
NW-TT and \"Time synchronization information for each DS-TT port\"
element in UMIC for each PTP port in DS-TT:

portDS.announceReceiptTimeout (for time-aware system and Boundary
Clock);

portDS.syncReceiptTimeout (for time-aware system);

portDS.logAnnounceInterval (for Boundary Clock).

portDS.initialLogAnnounceInterval,
portDS.useMgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval and
portDS.mgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval (for time-aware system).

### K.2.2.3 Configuration for PTP port states

The PTP port states may be determined by NW-TT either via:

\- Method a), BMCA procedure.

\- Method b), local configuration.

When Method b) is used, the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets the
defaultDS.externalPortConfigurationEnabled (per PTP instance) in UMIC to
TRUE, and sets the value of externalPortConfigurationPortDS.desiredState
(per PTP port) in UMIC for each DS-TT port and in PMIC for each NW-TT
port for the (g)PTP domain.

### K.2.2.4 Configuration for PTP grandmaster function

The following options may be supported (per DS-TT) for the 5GS to
generate the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages for the Leader ports
on the DS-TT:

a\) NW-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages on behalf
of DS-TT (e.g. if DS-TT does not support this).

b\) DS-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages in this
DS-TT.

TSN AF and TSCTSF may use the elements in port and user plane node
management information container to determine the PTP grandmaster
functionality supported by DS-TT and NW-TT and may configure the DS-TT
and NW-TT ports to operate as in option a) or b) as follows:

\- The \"PTP grandmaster capable\" element and the \"gPTP grandmaster
capable\" element in PMIC are used to indicate the support for PTP or
gPTP grandmaster capability, respectively, in each DS-TT. If the TSN AF
or TSCTSF determines the DS-TT supports grandmaster capability (PTP or
gPTP grandmaster capable is TRUE), then either option a) or b) can be
used for the PTP instance(s) in the DS-TT. Otherwise, only option a) can
be used for the PTP instance(s) in the DS-TT.

\- To enable option a) for PTP ports in DS-TT, the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets
the element \"Grandmaster on behalf of DS-TT enabled\" TRUE (per PTP
instance per DS-TT) in UMIC for the respective DS-TT port, and the TSN
AF or TSCTSF sets the element \"Grandmaster enabled\" FALSE (per PTP
instance per DS-TT) in PMIC to the respective DS-TT port.

\- To enable option b) for PTP ports in DS-TT, the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets
the element \"Grandmaster on behalf of DS-TT enabled\" FALSE in UMIC
(per PTP instance per DS-TT) for the respective port, and the TSN AF or
TSCTSF sets the element \"Grandmaster enabled\" TRUE (per PTP instance
per DS-TT) in PMIC to the respective DS-TT port.

\- To enable either option a) or option b) for a PTP instance, the TSN
AF or TSCTSF sets the element \"Grandmaster candidate enabled\" TRUE
(per PTP instance) in UMIC.

\- When option b) is used for one or more PTP ports in DS-TT(s), the TSN
AF or TSCTSF shall use the elements in defaultDS in PMIC for the
respective DS-TT(s) and in UMIC for NW-TT to ensure that all PTP ports
in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT in particular PTP instance are distributing
the same values of grandmasterPriority1, grandmasterClockQuality,
grandmasterPriority2, grandmasterIdentity, and timeSource message fields
in Announce messages.

### K.2.2.5 Configuration for Sync and Announce intervals

The TSN AF or TSCTSF uses the values in portDS.logSyncInterval (for
Boundary Clock) or portDS.initialLogSyncInterval,
portDS.useMgtSettableLogSyncInterval and
portDS.mgtSettableLogSyncInterval (for time-aware system) to configure
the interval for the Sync messages (per PTP port) as described in
IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] or IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\], respectively. The
TSCTSF or TSN AF configures those values as follows:

\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports
in NW-TT.

\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use the \"Time synchronization information for each
DS-TT port\" element in UMIC to configure the values for PTP ports in
DS-TT(s) if NW-TT acts as GM on behalf of those DS-TTs.

\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports
in DS-TT if the DS-TT is capable of acting as a GM.

When the NW-TT generates the (g)PTP Sync messages on behalf of the
DS-TT, the NW-TT uses the values in the element \"Time synchronization
information for each DS-TT port\" in UMIC to determine the Sync interval
for the PTP ports the respective DS-TT. When DS-TT generates the (g)PTP
Sync messages, the DS-TT uses the values in PMIC to determine the Sync
interval for the PTP ports in this DS-TT.

The TSN AF or TSCTSF uses the values in portDS.logAnnounceInterval (for
Boundary Clock) or portDS.initialLogAnnounceInterval,
portDS.useMgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval and
portDS.mgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval (for time-aware system) to
configure the interval for the Announce messages (per PTP port) as
described in IEEE Std 1588 \[126\] and IEEE Std 802.1AS \[104\],
respectively. The TSCTSF or TSN AF configures those values as follows:

\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports
in NW-TT.

\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use the \"Time synchronization information for each
DS-TT port\" element in UMIC to configure the values for PTP ports in
DS-TT(s) if NW-TT acts as GM on behalf of those DS-TTs.

\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports
in DS-TT if the DS-TT is capable of acting as a GM.

When the NW-TT generates the (g)PTP Announce messages on behalf of the
DS-TT, the NW-TT uses the values in the element \"Time synchronization
information for each DS-TT port\" in UMIC to determine the Announce
interval for the PTP ports the respective DS-TT. When DS-TT generates
the (g)PTP Announce messages, the DS-TT uses the values in PMIC to
determine the Announce interval for the PTP ports in this DS-TT.

### K.2.2.6 Configuration for transport protocols

The procedure described in this clause is applicable when the PTP
Profile that is used for the PTP instance in 5GS defines multiple
permitted transport protocols.

TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the element \"Supported transport types\" in
port management information container (per DS-TT) to determine the
supported transport types in the DS-TT. TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the
element \"Supported transport types\" in UMIC (per NW-TT) to determine
the supported transport types in the NW-TT.

The TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the element \"Transport type\" (per PTP
instance) in PMIC to configure the transport protocol in use for the PTP
instance in DS-TT. The TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the element \"Transport
type\" (per PTP instance) in UMIC to configure the transport protocol in
use for the PTP instance in NW-TT.

The PTP instance shall be configured to use one of the following
transport protocols:

1\) Ethernet as described in Annex E of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\]. The
Ethertype as defined for PTP shall be used. The related Ethernet frames
carry the PTP multicast Ethernet destination MAC address.

2\) UDP over IPv4 as described in Annex C of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\],

3\) UDP over IPv6 as described in Annex D of IEEE Std 1588 \[126\].

Option 1 applies to Ethernet PDU Session type. Options 2 and 3 apply to
IP PDU Session type or Ethernet PDU Session type with IP payload.

########  Annex L (normative): Support of GERAN/UTRAN access

This annex applies when the SMF+PGW-C is enhanced to support UE
accessing the network via GERAN/UTRAN over Gn/Gp interface. For this
scenario, the SMF+PGW-C uses N7 interface to interact with PCF and the
N40 interface to interact with CHF.

NOTE 1: For the interface with the serving node of the UE, the SMF+PGW-C
is assumed to behave as the Control Plane of the PGW described in
Annex D of TS 23.401 \[26\].

SMF+PGW-C selection by SGSN is specified in Annex G of TS 23.502 \[2\].

The SMF+PGW-C interacting with PCF for GERAN/UTRAN access is specified
in Annex G of TS 23.502 \[2\].

The functional description for SMF+PGW-C interacting with PCF to support
GERAN/UTRAN access is specified in TS 23.503 \[3\].

NOTE 2: Support for IP address preservation upon mobility between 5GS
and GERAN/UTRAN for PDN sessions established in EPC is described in
clause 5.17.2.4. IP address preservation is not supported for direct
mobility between 5GS and GERAN/UTRAN, nor for indirect mobility cases
when the PDN session is established in 5GS or in GERAN/UTRAN.

The charging services on SMF+PGW-C interactions with CHF for GERAN/UTRAN
access are specified in TS 32.255 \[68\].
